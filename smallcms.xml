				<title>Things You Must Check Before You Buy a Plot</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51699</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It can be quite overwhelming to see your dream home become a reality, but it is not easy to have possession of your own plot in a desired locality. It is quite a laborious task, a lot of bargaining, paper work, and of course it costs a lot. The first thing you need to do before you buy a piece of land is to know if the land is for sale and the details of the original land owner. You may want to check out a few things before you make your first step into buying your own plot:

<strong>Ask yourself if investing into a land is a good decision</strong>

Looking into returns from properties, it has been a well-known secret that buying a plot and constructing your home, can earn big returns than buying an apartment or a flat in town. So if you are lucky, you can find a plot in a busy and sought after residential area in town as its real value may go up ten to twenty folds over a period of five years. This is one of the primary reasons why people tell you to invest in a plot rather than an apartment property.

<strong>Be careful with your paper work before you plan to buy your plot or land</strong>

Buying a plot can be a challenging and tedious process. Try to hire a land or real estate agent to cross check all the documents and verify the claims made by the landlord. It is better to know if the land has been approved for sale by the municipal corporation for a residential property or if the property was involved in a recent legal dispute. Today, landlords have been known to abuse the ignorance of the buyer by not fully sharing all the information as depicted in the paper work. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you consult a real estate lawyer or hire an agent to check all your paper work before you make up your mind to purchase the plot.

Before you begin the process, there is a lot of paperwork that needs to be carefully checked. The first and foremost thing is to determine if the land falls outside the purview of an agriculture land as such a land cannot be bought without the authorization and permission from the district collector. Here are some listed documents to verify before you buy yourself a plot:

<strong>Document 7/12</strong>

This is the basic document information that is available to a buyer like name of the land lord, the area of the land, title deed. This document should also carry information in regards to the 6/12 document describing how the land changes owners.

<strong>Encumbrance Certificate</strong>

This certificate states that the land is not involved in any earlier legal battle of disputes. Generally, an encumbrance document dates back to at least 30 years so as to be fully sure that no legal disputes have occurred in the past.

<strong>Release certificate</strong>

In some circumstances, the land may have been pledged to obtain a bank loan and therefore, you might need to request for a release certificate from the bank to free you of any dues owed to the bank. In circumstances where in the land is held by more than one owner or landlord, ask the certificate from all the people involved in the deed.

<strong>Tax bills and receipts</strong>

Ask the municipal corporation for all tax receipts that have been paid until now to be sure that all records are well maintained and are up to date.

Before signing the deal, make sure you measure the land in the presence of a land surveying officer and make certain that the measurements are accurate. Additionally, also verify if the land has been reserved by the state government for any project that has not been publicly disclosed. If you are fully satisfied with the purchasing of the plot, all you may need to do is to pay the stamp duty and register the land. Ensure that the entire procedure is completed and that your name is mentioned in the municipal records.

As there is a lot of paper work, you may want to think about purchasing a built in property or prefer to buy plots available in township or have the option of buying a plot from a developer as it could be a cheap and viable option.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Why You Should Invest in Home Improvement Before Selling It?</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51701</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Real estate agents and brokers attach too much significance to the ‚Äòlocation‚Äô of property, especially if you are trying to sell your property through them. You will be glad to know that there are other ways of selling your property and for top dollar. A sure shot way of selling your home easily is to invest in a bit of home improvement, before you put it up for sale in the real estate market. Given below are some reasons why home improvement can play a crucial role in the sale of your property.

<strong>Nobody wants to invest in a damaged property</strong>

If you have stayed in your home even for a couple of years, and are now looking to sell it for profits, then there is a huge likelihood that you need to check if your property needs any repairs. A crack in the wall or slightly discoloured walls may not be of much importance to you, but can make a world of difference to the buying decision of a potential buyer. Before you put up your house for sale, you must ensure that your house is free of repairs.

<strong>Invest in the beautification of the interiors of your property</strong>

All potential buyers look to buy properties that are not only in a good location and are functional, but also that are pleasantly decorated and aesthetically pleasing. Remember, this one may be an old property for you, but for the potential buyer, it is his dream home, and he/she would not settle for anything less than that. You must ensure that interiors are well done, walls well painted in subtle colours and floors should be sparkling clean. Similarly, cupboards should be clean and fully functional. Try and look at your interiors from a buyer‚Äôs perspective, and make all repairs that are required to make your property appealing to all potential buyers.

<strong>Pay equal attention to the curb appeal of your property</strong>

Curb appeal of your property is one of its biggest selling factors; there is no two ways about it. If the entrance and outdoor parts of your house is unkempt and unappealing, then it is very likely that many buyers won‚Äôt even enter your home to check out the interiors. This is because most buyers simply assume that the interiors are as rumpled as the outdoors.

<strong>Small-ticket items can make a huge difference</strong>

When it comes to the sale of any property, entrance gate, main door, windows, garage and deck are not big-ticket items, but can help considerably in sealing the deal with the buyer. By updating these aspects of your home, you ensure that your home has got an instant facelift and is aesthetically pleasing. When potential buyers drive up to see your house that is on sale, they want to see a home that is well-kept and well maintained.

<strong>Invest in kitchen and bathroom upgrades</strong>

Kitchen and bathrooms are parts of your house that can considerably boost the value of your house. Remember, no household can do without a functional kitchen or bathroom. Try and upgrade your kitchen and bathroom with the latest in the market to ensure that potential buyers do not hesitate to shell out that extra penny on your property.

While it is a good idea to invest in home improvement to fetch better returns, it is equally important to stay away from personalizing your property to your family‚Äôs unique needs. If you have decided to sell your house, then you must detach yourself from it and then remodel or repair it to meet the needs of a potential buyer.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Top Lighting and D√©cor Ideas</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51703</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The lighting in any area makes or breaks the mood, functionality and is used as an element of d√©cor these days. This article will focus on lighting in the home, and how to use lighting well to enhance or hide any feature of a living space.

One way of looking at lighting is to examine what it is to be used for. Is it a light that will be used every day? Or will it be switched on, only on a special occasion to highlight a particular feature of the house? Is the light going to be used just during a festive celebration, such as a birthday, Christmas, or Diwali? Choosing the light will be greatly affected by this parameter.

Another key point to be kept in mind is where in the house the light will be used. Hallway, living area, dining room, kitchen, bedroom, study and the bathroom will all need different kinds of functionality and aesthetic appeal in the lighting that is used there.

Lighting will need to blend in with the overall architectural and design theme of the house. Based on whether the interior theme is contemporary, classical or quirky, the choice of light fixtures will also change. Lights are seen as part of the design of a house, and not something added on at a later point in time. So what are the factors to be kept in mind when choosing a light fixture that will be part of a room's d√©cor? Style, shape, colour and size.

<strong>Types of Lights</strong>

‚Ä¢ Chandeliers have been a classic lighting decor accent for centuries now. Chandeliers are big and showy, and these days, come in many designs to appeal to any kind of decor theme, not just the classical western theme. A chandelier can be the focal point in a room, and is typically used in the formal drawing room. However, some designers suggest using chandeliers in unexpected places like a corridor or bathroom, which makes this big showy lighting fixture suddenly very personal.

‚Ä¢ Pendant lights is another term that is used for a fixture suspended from the ceiling by a chain or cord. Even a chandelier is a type of pendant light. For this discussion, pendants refer to the more modern lights that are used over tables and counters to draw attention to a particular part of the room. Pendants can be hung individually or as a group. Sometimes, the pendant is used to throw patterned light on the walls around it if its shade has patterns on it.

‚Ä¢ Another overhead lighting option is ceiling-mount light fixtures. These offer a good blend of practicality and design, without being as conspicuous as pendants. A kitchen or hallway are good spots to use these fixtures.

‚Ä¢ Wall sconces can be used to direct light upwards or downwards, as the case may be. They are used in bathrooms as well as to highlight art on walls. They need to be integrated with the overall d√©cor theme, so that they don‚Äôt jar the aesthetic eye.

‚Ä¢ Table and floor lamps offer portability and directed interest to different corners of a room. Typically, the lampshades of these lamps are thematically chosen, and can add the element of scale to a room. One of the easiest and economical ways of re-decorating a house is to just change the table or floor lamp/lampshade.

‚Ä¢ Recessed lighting is part of many a sleek modern home. These light fixtures offer the resident and the visitor clean and straight lines.

Lighting is not just an architectural element these days. It is also used by designers to enhance the appeal of a living space. Lights and light fixtures are seen as necessary accessories while decorating a house. Good use of dimmers, dramatic placements, plate diffusers and unexpected grouping of lights can be used to a design advantage.

Thus it is seen that lighting is not just functional, but one of the main considerations of d√©cor in a house.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Tips for Decorating Your First Apartment</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The first apartment is usually a rental, and in some cases, a self-purchased home. Most people approach the whole process of decorating this space with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. The fear is of not having enough budget to decorate as per the dream. Not to worry, a beautifully decorated home is a product of one of these: enough money or enough time. When you are decorating your first apartment, you have more of time than money, and that is more than enough to make the entire decorating process enjoyable and the results spectacular.

<strong>One at a time</strong>

Examine your life. Which room do you spend the most time in? Decorate that room first. If you spend hours cooking, then the kitchen will be your first room of focus. Will you host many parties? Then focus on the living/drawing room. If you read a lot in the bedroom, then ensure that room is decorated first, in a manner that pleases you. Breaking the decorating down into room-sized projects simplifies the whole process and allows you to choose your pace, spending and detailing.

<strong>Be smart with your budget</strong>

You do not have to have designer furniture and accessories in every room in your new apartment. If something expensive catches your fancy, do not immediately purchase it. Check if you can get knock-offs at a fraction of the cost from a flea market or garage sale. If you are investing in something expensive, ensure it is a long-lasting classic, and you will not lose interest in it once this season is over. That is one way of making your rupee go a long way.

<strong>Do It yourself (DIY)</strong>

Many home projects can be easily done by you, rather than hiring that expensive carpenter or painter. A generic MDF stool or cupboard can look ravishing with just a new coat of paint or by doing a decoupage project on it. There are tutorials available on the internet for any kind of DIY for the home ‚Äì it merely requires interest, investment in time and a bit of creativity from you.

<strong>Play with Colour</strong>

Colour can be your best friend to decorate your first apartment. The trend these days is to go for one accented wall in a room. The problem with that is that the colour scheme for that room then becomes almost permanent till the next painting is done. A simpler way of incorporating colour in a room is by keeping the base colours neutral and by adding bright spots through cushions, art work or lighting. This will allow you to change the colour scheme of a room in a cost-effective manner.

<strong>Many functions</strong>

See if you can use utility items in more than one way. One example is the tray table, which can be used for entertaining in the living room, as a bedside table in the bedroom or as a coffee table in a balcony. Another example is the sofa-cum-bed. This versatile piece of furniture can be used as a couch in the daytime and when extended, becomes a guest bed. By using the same item for more than one purpose, you are getting more bang for your buck.

<strong>Use Linen</strong>

It is easier (and cheaper) to buy new curtains for a room than to totally decorate it. When decorating your first apartment, linen is one of the easiest ways of brightening up a room, be it the living room, bedroom, kitchen or even bathroom. Curtains for the windows, frilled skirts for tables and bathroom sinks, table cloths for dining tables and study tables, bedspreads, throws for couches ‚Äì all these can help the first time decorator effectively.

The process of decorating your home need not be a one-time effort. You can continually do it over time, adding decorative pieces to reflect your personality and interests, and make your home a true extension of you.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Tips for Renting Out Apartments in Mumbai</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51717</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2015 05:14:38 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your apartment in Mumbai is ready to be rented out. Whether the apartment is located in Colaba or Mira Road, Juhu or Dombivili, there are some factors that are particular to Mumbai. What are these factors that you should keep in mind before and while renting out your Mumbai apartment? Given below is an insight:

<strong>Real Estate Agents</strong>

As in most other cities, Mumbai too runs on its network of real estate brokers. The agents form the vine to transmit information about available properties, and also perform a renter filtering process by default. The broker usually demands a fee from both the landlord as well as the tenant, which is typically one month‚Äôs rent, and can help in all the formalities connected to the rental process. Some professional real estate agents prepare a Letter of Intent that summarizes the terms and conditions of the rental agreement. This could include rent amount, rent payment structure, deposit, each party's liability towards duties and fees, dates and durations, etc. This document helps in keeping the whole transaction transparent and contention-free.

<strong>Corporate Renters</strong>

Mumbai is home to many corporate offices, and the employees of these companies are on the lookout for apartments that they can rent on company lease. It is a good idea to specify to the broker/estate agent that you are open to corporate rentals, when you are looking for a tenant. The advantage is that you need not do too much of due diligence on such a tenant, since corporates tend to default much less on rents.

<strong>Society/Building Associations</strong>

Most residents‚Äô associations in Mumbai apartment complexes are run methodically, and are a strong voice in making and enforcing rules. It is a good idea to speak to the office holders of the association about your flat coming up on rent. There are rules about renting out based on marital status or food habits of the resident, allowing pets or not, charges to be paid for using the lift for shifting household goods, etc. Once you know these rules, you will be in a good position to detail all of them to a prospective tenant. The association is the central point in a complex for rental queries, and the office bearers can let you know the process to publicize your flat availability through them. Many times, the association will need to approve the renter that you have selected, based on their rules.

<strong>Use of Online Portals and Social Media</strong>

There are several online portals where you can advertise that your property is available for rent. Many are free, some charge a nominal amount. Even Facebook has dedicated groups where you can try and get a tenant without paying a broker. Some sites offer a virtual walk-through of your property, and this service can be valuable to attract prospective tenants.

<strong>Deposit Amount</strong>

A tenant is expected to deposit a certain amount of money with the landlord at the beginning of the rental period. In Mumbai, this amount is roughly six months‚Äô rent, but can be negotiated. Different cities in India follow different patterns for this deposit amount.

<strong>Registration of Rental Agreement and Police Verification</strong>

Once both the landlord and the tenant come to a compromise regarding the terms and conditions on the draft rental agreement, the agreement needs to be registered at the local government office. The landlord is held responsible for ensuring that this gets done. From a practical perspective, the real estate agent helps out with this part of the process too. Simultaneously, a page is submitted to the local police department too, with details of the property, landlord, tenant and broker. This too is a mandatory step in the process. If the tenant is not an Indian citizen, the police can ask him/her to visit the police station for in-person verification. The broker typically provides templates for both the rental agreement as well as the police verification sheet.

With this wealth of knowledge, you are now better prepared to rent out your Mumbai apartment.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Affordable Housing Hubs on Mysore Road</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Affordable-Housing.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-48482" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px;" alt="Affordable Housing" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Affordable-Housing-300x200.jpg" width="240" height="160" /></a>With ample availability of land on the outskirts of Bangalore, many micro markets have turned into hubs of affordable housing.¬†A case in point is Mysore Road where prices are comparatively cheaper and affordable. Despite the overall slowdown in the real estate market across the country, prices have seen decent appreciation here since 2012.

The region has a blend of affordable and mid-segment properties with few in the luxury category as well. 2BHKs are the most preferred configurations by home seekers in these areas. Demand here is largely driven by people working in the industrial clusters situated in and around this stretch.

<b>Key Micro Markets</b>

Mysore Road in Bangalore is one stretch that has witnessed decent real estate activity over the last 3-4 years. ¬†According to CommonFloor data, following are some of the key micro markets that have shown a spurt in affordable housing:

<b>Chamrajpet to Nayandanahalli</b>: Residential prices in this area stand at approximately Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per sq ft, going higher, depending on the quality of the builder.

<b>Rajarajeshwarinagar</b>: One of the primary benefits of the area is that it is a well-planned zone, as are all its sub-divisions such as Uttarahalli Main Road and Kengeri. Most of the roads here are about 60 ft. wide.

<b>Kengeri:</b> A well-developed satellite town, it will command great connectivity to South Bangalore once the Metro Phase II is complete. The setting up of the Traffic Transit Management Centre (TTMC) of the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation will bode well for the area.

<b>Banashankari 5th &amp; 6th Stage:</b> These are other leading markets along Mysore Road where there is growing demand for housing over the last 3 to 4 years. There has been decent appreciation of property values since 2012.

<b>Pricing Patterns</b>

<b>Layouts &amp; Plots: </b>According to CommonFloor data, the average price of layouts and plots projects within the NICE Ring Road towards Bangalore is around Rs 3,650 per sq ft whereas the average price of layouts and plots beyond the NICE Ring Road towards Mysore is said to be Rs 1,150 per sq ft.

Muddaiahnapalya is a locality near Mysore Road where the development authority has proposed to develop 2000 acres of land into residential land-use due to which many developers have started developing layout and plots projects around the locality.

<b>Apartments &amp; Villa Projects: </b>Maximum apartment projects launched in the last three years were in the range of Rs 3,000-5,000 per sq ft belonging to the affordable to mid segment with very few in the luxury category.

Prices of projects beyond the NICE Ring Road towards Mysore are not less when compared to those of within NICE Ring Road towards Bangalore. This is mainly because all the projects beyond NICE Ring Road are huge projects with number of amenities being developed by renowned developers.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Things to Know Before Purchasing Property via Online Portals</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51798</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a digital era, and the Internet today has penetrated our lives like never before. Almost every adult member of the middle and upper class family is hooked to social media and other online portals for at least an hour a day. Mind you, there are also individuals that are addicted to social media and Internet, and spend much more time online per day. In such a scenario, and when the offline sales of properties have hit the rock bottom because of many reasons, a number of property portals are marketing online through social media and through their websites. Some have even gone to the extent of allowing potential buyers to book properties through online portals, especially as many buyers are NRIs or from other regions or states, and hence cannot be physically present while booking the property.

Research proves that more than half of the property buying decisions in Metros as well as in Tier II cities today are influenced by online searches and Internet research. One of the primary reasons for this changed trend is that today there is increased transparency increased confidence in online information and transactions.
If you are one of those property buyers who are seriously interested in booking a property through online portals, then the given below tips will surely be of help to you:

<strong>The online property booking amount is non-refundable</strong>

Online real estate portals create a win-win situation for the buyer as well as the builder. These engage potential buyers and generate serious and genuine leads for the developer. While it translates into ease and convenience for the buyer and profitability for the seller, the real estate portals make profits through commissions. Also, in almost all cases of online property booking, the amount is refundable; unless you are sure of purchasing the property, it is highly recommended that you do not book the property online as otherwise you will lose the booking amount for good.

<strong>The minimum booking amount through online portals is Rs 20,000</strong>

Online booking amount for almost any property is Rs 20,000. This is generally the commission of the online portal as it directs a genuine buyer to the developer. Remember, while it is easy to book a property online, the same is not true about purchasing it. For purchasing a property, the buyer must be physically present, and if that is not possible, then you may also lose the booking amount of Rs 20, 000.

<strong>Check the authenticity of the online real estate portal before booking a property through it</strong>

The buying decision has moved online to certain extent, but there is also a need to check the authenticity of the online portal before booking a property through it. Online transactions, be it property related or otherwise, has a certain level of risk associated with it. Before you book a property, you must check if the developer or builder has an official tie-up with the website for bookings. Such a move will help you safeguard your interests.

Online real estate portals have many advantages; these allow potential buyers to check details of a number of projects and then determine on the purchase of the one that interests them most. Some go to the extent of providing videos of model flats and CCTV camera updates of the current construction stage of the project. All these aspects certainly help the buyers in taking the right buying decision. If the buyers are confident about the project, and have decided to purchase it for sure, then it is best to book the property online as soon as possible; however, just remember to book it through a reputable real estate portal.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Challenges the Construction Industry Faces Today</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51800</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The construction industry in India is facing quite a few serious challenges, thanks to the increasing costs of construction material and no respite from the government in the recent budget. The worst part is the announcement of the increase in service tax which would further hurt the construction industry. To say the least, the construction market is today stingy with tighter margins. Some of the challenges faced by the construction companies in India are discussed below:

<strong>Lack of capital or undercapitalization</strong>

Operating funds or capital is very important for the successful functioning of any company, and the construction industry is no exception. Undercapitalization is one of the most serious issues faced by construction companies in India. Today new capitalization opportunities come to the fore as construction companies try and procure capital from foreign investors in India. Liberalization of policies and well measured attempts by the government to open up FDI is likely to encourage foreign investors to participate.

<strong>Lack of timely payments and positive cash flow</strong>

Bad cash flows can hurt any type of business; the construction industry is one of the worst hit by this issue as getting timely payments in the construction sector is quite difficult. One missed payment by a client may hurt the company very bad, and hence it is highly recommended that companies do not miss there draw dates and take stringent steps to ensure positive cash flow.

<strong>Increase in the quantum of incomplete or stalled projects</strong>

The year-on-year number for stalled real estate projects is nearly twenty percent. This has adverse effect on the profitability of many construction companies. Increased complexity of projects has increased the risk of failure and incompletions.

<strong>Delays in completion</strong>

In spite of meticulous planning by the developers at the inception stage, more and more projects are getting delayed in India. Needless to say that these unforeseen delays have a huge negative impact on the profit margins of construction Companies.

<strong>Poor and high-cost transportation facilities</strong>

Construction companies have to move equipment and construction material to distant places, and poor and high-cost transportation facilities lack what it takes to augment the profitability of the construction sector.

<strong>Growing demand for pre-fabricated construction material</strong>

Pre-fabricated construction material has come up as a cost-effective option for many who look for affordable housing options. Growing demand for such pre-fabricated material has a negative impact on the demand faced by construction industry, and hence also on their profits.

Construction is the second largest economic activity in India, lagging just behind agriculture. It accounts for more than 65 per cent of the total infrastructure investment. The construction industry in India has been growing slowly but consistently in India, thanks to the numerous infrastructure projects announced and undertaken by the government of India. However, it is also a fact that the construction Industry in India has been facing severe hurdles and challenges in the recent past, thanks to some stringent policies and taxes by the government.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>How to Decorate With the Red Colour</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51803</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Red is a bold colour that immediately makes people sit up and take notice of it. Many of us are intimidated with the intensity of the red colour, but not anymore. You must look at the red colour as a means to create a focal point and grab attention. For example, look at the traffic signal light, the fire engine or the police beacon.

<strong>Make a statement with red colour</strong>

Orange tinted tones of red make you feel alive and energized. They make you alert and keep you on your toes, while subtle colours of purple or burgundy can offer understated vibe and can look rather old fashioned. Whatever be the case, red continues to be a statement colour and you‚Äôll need to choose carefully your shade of red. One of the best approaches to using red is to first check out the house‚Äôs architecture and the decoration theme that you are going to incorporate in your design. Here are five tips to decorating your home with red.

<strong>Add red to your kitchen</strong>

Adding red to your kitchen helps to stimulate your appetite and is a wonderful expression of improving your taste. Red has a natural touch and can transform your kitchen into a modern, yet a passionate room. If you have windows on all four sides of your kitchen, you can use a glossy red paint on the cabinets all the way to the staircase. You can complement it with black and white vitrified tiles to pull together the fixtures and furnishings as well.

<strong>Use red depending on your personality type</strong>

If you are an obsessive individual, you may want to be seeing red literally all over your living space. Red can tweak your emotions from happiness, being cheerful, angry and also being aggressive and moody. So you got to be sure when you are using red. Using red as an accent colour in your interiors helps to draw attention to many other things in your room, like pillow covers, art frames, etc. that you normally don't notice. Also look at some of your favourite things like an attractive bracelet with red ruby stones or a piece of treasured fabric that has been your family masterpiece and use these to make a red statement.

Since red is an intense colour, you can confidently use strong accessories like a large dressing table with a mirror top. An oriental red rug with brown undertone is a great way to express your feeling or passion for red. Designers often use a large full room sized rug to create a rich red experience to the monochromatic living space. They also include some accessories to decorate the space elegantly. A brilliant idea is to use lacquered trays or plates to create that bold red display across your wall. Red is considered as a stimulating and the most brilliant of all colours. Using a little bit of red can be an excess. You can think of your grandmother‚Äôs old chest box and decorate it with a blend of black and red lacquer. It could help you bring back memories.

Here are a few designs that corporate red well:

<strong>Modern design</strong>

It generally incorporates all shades of red from classical shades to principal hues, along with brown or cherry red undertones. Doors can be coated with any red as they all make a statement. The interiors need to have red included in famous art pieces or paintings.

<strong>Contemporary design</strong>

Natural elements with occasional inclusion of red pop ups can be used. The doors need to be bold and painted in a bright red shade, while the interiors require red to appear on pillows.

<strong>Traditional design</strong>

This design normally stays away from red, while keeping the burgundy‚Äôs and brown undertones. The doors need to be painted in deep and rich colour of red. When it comes to the interiors, try to decorate with oriental rugs with frequent shades or spots of red.

<strong>Transitional design</strong>

This design is often based on a neutral palette and utilizes a canvas of red. The doors are perfectly coated and matches with the hues which you have used on the interiors. The interiors have an indulgent red like a piece of art or a light shade.

<strong>Country reds</strong>

They are usually softer and include scarlet reds. Normally pinkish reds or purple hues are likely to be used. Many designers prefer colours from nature. The doors incorporate a barn red colour.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Re-designing and decorating a boy‚Äôs room today is not as easy as it seems superficially. Boys today are super specific about what they want in their room and are not ready to compromise a bit on the d√©cor front. This is especially true when it comes to the colours in the room. If you are planning to re-design your kid‚Äôs bedroom, then there is huge probability that you are already browsing interior d√©cor pages and magazines to the maximum. No doubt, it is going to take plenty of bargaining, a bit of compromise with your son‚Äôs tastes and a few creative ideas that can lead to harmonious agreement between you and your son.

We have some really simple tips that can help you with the right colours for your boy‚Äôs room.

<strong>Painting your boy‚Äôs room with a fresh and vibrant colour can immediately overhaul the room</strong>

Painting your boy‚Äôs room can instantly transform the look of the room and can be done in a cost effective way. Sometimes, when you rather feel that many of your d√©cor ideas are simply not going to work, you should rather resort to painting the room afresh. First and foremost, think of a classic colour like blue for your young son‚Äôs bedroom and then you can design the entire space with reds or browns or dark cherry colours. Normally, many kids‚Äô rooms by default carry hues, as these vibrant hues make boys comfortable and lively.

<strong>Go for bold colours if your kid likes them</strong>

Generally in a boy‚Äôs room, strong, bright and bold colours go well, so try to use beige and browns or muted shades to make a bold statement. Yellow accents or apple greens can also be used and can draw a natural sunny atmosphere. Using burgundy or cherry red furniture or framed artwork with warm latte or beige shades painted walls can also spring up a surprise.

<strong>Colours for older boys</strong>

If you have older kids in your home, greys can look fabulous with dark brown or black furnishings. Also incorporate a few fabric covers or pillows in a dash of red or pink. Boys, who are outdoor loving guys, generally prefer energetic colours of orange or red. These colours allow them to be energetic and lively and provide extra motivation for their studies. Blue shades are quite adorable and are available in many shades and hues.

<strong>Blue for your boy‚Äôs room</strong>

If your boys are blue loving kids, you can spread blue linen or curtains on the windows or use accessories with the inclusion of blue to create a strong force. Be careful of your choice of the blue shade as it can sometimes go wrong. Different designs and shades of blue are today available from classic sea blue depicting the sea to the patriotic star and stripes. Try to select gentle hues of blue to create a classy sea coast interior. To complement blue, you can add, bright pops of orange or green on your pillows. Use soft corals and shells and maybe you can also try a surf board to make it adventurous and playful.

If you are looking to create a teen bedroom, you can even use a blue that is flexible and can be easily combined with white and red. Blue with white stripes are quite popular and boy like to improvise it with useful accessories that truly are admirable and add to your son‚Äôs personality and character. Additionally, dark coffee or cocoa browns can add a flare to your boy‚Äôs space. A rug with wavy zebra lines or a printed rug with a pattern can be used to make it more environmental friendly, yet modern and sophisticated.

<strong>Avoid wall papers, as your boy‚Äôs taste is going to change soon</strong>

You should also remember that your son is going to grow quickly and the wall paper on the walls with trains, cars or soccer balls are going to be annoying and outdated soon. Instead, you may need to sit around with him and weave him into the decors he may want in his room space. Use creativity to arrange the room with proper placement of head lamps, models or art frames, toys, wall hangings or models hung from the ceiling. Vertical stripes can be an added advantage as it elegantly brings out the depth of the hanging art or toys models and creates a focal point and increases the visual effect of the room.

You can also simply paint a strip across the wall stretching horizontally about 10 inches from the roof and close down to your son‚Äôs bed board. Paintings of his favourite cartoon character are also an attractive way to maintain the spirit in the room, but be careful he would soon outgrow it.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>How to Make Our Cities Sustainable and Smart</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From the time the new government came to power at the centre, it has been consistently talking about smart and sustainable cities. Its plan to build 100 smart cities and to redevelop existing urban regions that have a population of more than 100,000. An estimated amount of US$ 1.2 billion is to be invested by the government of India in the making of these smart cities. Not only that, this investment is also being supplemented by private funding from foreign investors.

The making of smart cities will encourage increased engagement from citizens, transition to e-governance through optimal use of technology. There are also plans to transform smart cities into zero emission and no waste zones by the way of resilient urban development plans. While all these points look very good on book, the creation of smart and sustainable cities requires much more. Given below are some strategies that must be employed to make our cities smart and sustainable:

<strong>Comprehensive urbanization strategy</strong>

Rapid and complete urbanization take much more than most of us anticipate; it requires latest technology and better employment opportunities that not only support financial growth, but also improves the standard of living of citizens. The focus must also be on rational land management, strategic urban design, better mobility and access to transform Indian cities into efficient, smart and sustainable cities.

<strong>Better transportation systems</strong>

The demand for good transportation systems must be met in cities to improve connectivity and to decrease pollution. The financial stability of public transport systems in quintessential and hence aspects such as private investments, subsidies, fair pricing and equitable access should be given due importance. As citizens, we must ensure that we make efficient use of transport systems without damaging or dirtying the properties.

<strong>Stringent building codes and control regulations</strong>

Smart cities simply cannot do without good building codes and development oriented control regulations. These regulations are a must as these have a crucial impact on the road safety, transit, walkability, etc. Not only that, equal focus should also be on mixed-use development of land on open public spaces. Naya Raipur is one such city which is pursuing this type of balanced development to create neighbourhoods that are safer, well-connected, well-organized and efficient.

<strong>Healthy investments while paying equal heed to equity</strong>

Good land acquisition and management strategies should be in place to procure land that can contribute towards inclusive and cost-effective development in cities. Smart infrastructure investments compensate city residents with better and well-developed facilities. Centre can take clues from land aggregation policies followed by different state governments and can determine on policies that have been effective in equitable acquisition of land.

<strong>Financing through smart public-private partnerships</strong>

A major part of the smart cities investment is supposed to come from public-private partnerships. Performance metrics and indicators across social, economic and environmental platforms are crucial to ensure that there is continual progress and enhanced accountability. Such a system is essential to ensure that smart cities receive enough funding from the private sector.

India is likely to have 100 smart cities by the end of 2030; smart cities cannot be built in just a day and need a lot of planning, design, finance, management and execution from the government‚Äôs end. However, the government cannot do it all alone and the citizens have to do their bit by maintaining civic sense, cleanliness and safety to ensure that smart and sustainable urban places are available to approximately 600 million citizens by 2030.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>How to Enhance Your Property Value</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51928</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 06:09:54 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is no denying the fact that the real estate sector has not performed as well as many of the industry experts expected it to perform in the last couple of years. There are many properties, residential and commercial, that are completed by developers, but have not found buyers or tenants. In such a market scenario, when the sale of a new property itself is challenging, the selling of a second hand property becomes doubly difficult. No wonder that many property sellers, in spite of their financial predicament, choose to wait for better days to sell their property.

Having said the above, if your property is in a good location and if its structure is strong enough, then a few steps at your end can ensure that your property is sold easily and with reasonable profits. Given below are few such steps that will help you enhance the value of your property:

<strong>Paint your house</strong>

Nothing enhances the value of your property like a fresh coat of paint does. Go for some modern colours and low-VOC paint, you have a property that is appealing and is also as good as new.

<strong>Create space</strong>

Transform the feel of the house by knocking down a wall that is blocking the flow in the house. By removing a non-structural wall, you will not only create space, but also will make it more open and bright, and thus more appealing to many potential buyers. Even the removal of a non-functional kitchen wall to transform the kitchen into an open one can work wonders for the value of your house.

<strong>Invest in landscaping</strong>

More often than not, property owners tend to forget the outdoors of their homes, which leads to bushy and unkempt trees and outdoors, than block the lighting and darken interiors. Needless to mention that tangled trees and shabby outdoors can hurt your property selling endeavours very badly. You must consider investing in landscaping as it can make a huge difference to the sale price of your property.

<strong>Remodel and upgrade the kitchen, but do not invest in fancy deluxe kitchen</strong>

You must remodel your kitchen before you put up your house for sale, especially as kitchen fittings and fixtures are prone to a lot of wear and tear and hence can have a negative impact on the overall value of the house (if left undone). However, while investing in an upgrade and remodel, you must ensure that you don‚Äôt overspend on a fancy and super luxurious kitchen, and that it simply adheres to the standard of other kitchens in the neighbourhood. Not only that the remodelled kitchen should also complement the overall d√©cor of the house to be a major selling point of your house.

<strong>Invest in good lighting fixtures</strong>

Often ignored by many, good lighting fixtures can overhaul the look of your house for good. Go for smart lighting options that use motion sensors and turn themselves off when lighting is not required. Use elegant lighting to bestow class and warmth to your property, thus enhancing its value.

There are several other things that you can do to enhance the value of your property, and you must inspect your house very carefully from a third person‚Äôs perspective to find loopholes and then repair and upgrade accordingly. For example, if you think that your bathroom fixtures are old and not appealing, then it would help to upgrade the fixtures.

Last but not the least, ensure that every nook and corner of your house that is on sales is sparkling clean. Your property should be free of clutter and dust to be able to find potential buyers. Remember, it may be an old house for you, but for the person who is going to buy it, it should be his dream house.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>How to Find Budget Homes In Kolkata</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51932</link>
		<pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 06:11:00 +0000</pubDate>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kolkata is one of the most vibrant metropolitan cities in India; a perfect amalgamation of modernity and tradition, the city is home to an eclectic mix of people from various walks and strata of society. However, what is common among most citizens of Kolkata is that they are looking for investing in properties that are within their budget, are affordable and still fall in the category of their dream homes.

Statistics reveal that most of the property buyers in Kolkata are interested in budget properties that fall in the price range of Rs 20-40 lakh. While it is true that most localities in Kolkata do not have any properties on sale in this budget, there are some localities that do have affordable properties on sale. Given below are a list of localities that are known to cater to the housing needs of middle class people:

<strong>Bansdroni, Behala and Garia</strong>

These three localities are in the southern part of Kolkata and have decent infrastructure and social facilities. These localities will soon be very well-connected with other central parts of the city, thanks to the near complete extension of EM Bypass Road. Also, metro line six, once completed will connect these localities with the International Airport, and also localities such as New Town, Sector V and Science City. These localities of Bansdroni, Behala and Garia that fall in the southern zone of Kolkata have quite many residential projects that offer budget apartments in the range of Rs 20-40 lakh; most of these one to two bedroom properties have size specifications of 700-1,000 sq. ft.

<strong>Kestopur in Eastern Zone</strong>

Kestopur is one neighborhood which is in close vicinity of localities such as Salt Lake and Rajarhat and offers budget properties to potential buyers. Needless to mention that Kestopur is just 4.5 km from Sector 5, approximately 7 km from Rajarhat and is at a closer distance to Salt City. Most of the properties that are up for sale here are two bed room properties in the size range of 800-1,100 sq. ft. and are in the price range of Rs 20-40 lakh. One can also find a few 3 bedroom properties in this price range, but the size specifications would be the same as two bedroom properties.

<strong>Rajarhat in the North Eastern Zone</strong>

Rajarhat in the north eastern zone of Kolkata is another well-developed area that has budget properties on offer for potential home buyers. A bit of online and offline research can help buyers find single, two or even three bedroom properties within the range of Rs 20-40 lakh. Most of the single bedroom flats have a maximum size of 700-900 sq. ft., double bedroom flats are 750-1,000 sq. ft. in size and triple bedroom flats have a carpet area of 1,000-1,200 sq. ft. Again, the price also depends on the amenities that are on offer with the project.

While most of these areas are pretty well developed, the comparatively lower price is attributed to the shortcomings in the connectivity to other central areas of the city. As mentioned above, there are a lot of infrastructure projects that are near completion and that will lead to better connectivity, which simply implies that real estate investments in these areas will appreciate well in the next couple of years.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>How to Mix Wood Tones in Your Home D√©cor</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=51934</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are an interior design enthusiast and are looking to add style to your living space, you would want to consider picking up simple individual pieces of d√©cor and furniture to match your design style and layout. You can begin with a variation in colour and then building on the pattern with an elegant style. There are many ways in which you can add style and elegance to your living room. A familiar approach is to combine contemporary and modern wood finishes to a particular room and add depth of colour to suit your personality and taste.

It is always a challenge to add different wood tones in one space and can be quite complex to blend and create the character and style of your choice. You have to keep in mind the outcome of your d√©cor style with the function and visual effect it reflects. Matching wood floor patterns and tones with furniture is not so straight forward and practical as it seems, as we tend to pick up our d√©cor and furnishings from different hard ware and furniture outlets.

As most of our furniture are inherited from our parents and grandparents, it poses a serious challenge as we try to mix or bring together the past with the new furniture that we have just bought. In order to maintain a harmonious arrangement and layout, you need to make a check list and pick specific furniture based on utility and space. It is a rewarding experience, but takes time to achieve that elusive harmonious unity. You need to consider these tips to achieve that blend of functional, elegant, cohesive, yet attractive touch of wood when it comes to wood tones.

We have a few suggestions to help you find a way of doing it right.

<strong>Flooring with wood</strong>

Depending on the design of your home, you can opt for wooden flooring. A wide range of options available, from tiles to carpet flooring, however, if you decide to go for a wooden floor, try to use undertones as a creative stimulus for the rest of the room. Use the ground design by exploring the hues from the furniture pieces and other wooden accessories or a carpet to make the transition step between large areas of wood floor and other d√©cor.

<strong>Furniture pieces</strong>

If you have some large pieces of wooden furniture in your space, make sure you use these as mid-level undertones. Large furniture like dining table or a couch with mid-level d√©cor tones can help you leverage the visual effect of the space, while light brown tones can prevent the style from being diverse and out of sync.

<strong>Use small accent furniture</strong>

It is a brilliant way to use light or dark wood tall furniture like book shelves, long tables, crockery units or television panels to help add contrasting tones to the space. Try to mix wood tones to create depth and effect to the room. Try to distribute light woods and dark tones around the space to make it look stunning and visually grand.

<strong>Blending fabric</strong>

An interesting way to create balance in the room is to introduce fabric shades to mimic or overlap wood colours and further enhance the design standard. Use brown throw away pillows on the sofa or couch to complement the dark furniture on either side of the side tables. Use also bed spreads to complement the dressing table teak frame mirrors. Using this technique of incorporating fabric into your room can intensify the d√©cor to a large extent.

<strong>Wood accessories</strong>

If you are an accessories collector, you can combine different wood toned accessories like art frames, lamp stands, and wooden framed mirrors to help create an accented wood design in the room. You can also use the coffee table or the side desk to place wooden photo frames, or bowls with classy coloured stones or pebbles, to make the space more aesthetic and natural. Accessories are known to create depth and are commonly used to raise the wooden design style to a new height.

Use these suggestions to create a beautiful home d√©cor blended with attractive wooden tones.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are planning to host a dinner part or calling your friends for a home get together around a cosy table or inviting family and friends for a weekend dinner, the first thing that comes to mind is your home dining ambience that needs to be in the spotlight. It defines your signature style from a traditional or a modern contemporary inspired design theme. Use creative tips and be inspired by natural ideas; try to dream, feel, explore and conceive. Make it a habit to follow your instincts and use your conviction to ensure you have a great result. Here are a few design tips to modernize your dining room.

<strong>Prefer a relaxed look with a neutral feel</strong>

When it comes to dining room ambience, less is more stylish and the design pays dividends. The best way is to avoid the plaids and instead line them up with antique paintings and linen and fabric. Try to incorporate artwork and large narrow shelves to draw a symmetrical dimension to your dinning crockery unit. Try to avoid clutter and build a casual seating arrangement. The space can serve as a reading seating or a dining room.

<strong>Go in for a splash of bold and vibrant colour</strong>

Today, home designers want a fresh, ventilated dining room. Use a light shade of peppermint green with shiny lacquered walls incorporated with light shades or white custom upholstered dining chairs. A brass antique chandelier or a glass painted lantern could add a touch of class to the dining ambience.

<strong>Choose your style and mix your colour</strong>

Visualize your style and try to achieve that personalized look. Create a unified colour to complement your d√©cor and your cabinet interiors.

<strong>Lighten your space with fabric</strong>

If you are looking to set a specific mood in your dining space, incorporate linen or fabric to help you set your tone. It adds an elegant touch to your dining space. Try to use innovate ideas like a Chinese built in storage space into your dinning wall space lined with beautiful aesthetic fabric. It can help you save space and helps a designer to integrate architectural design into a decorative trim work.

<strong>Add a touch of tradition</strong>

Use an open space traditional dining plan to create the intimacy of a confined dining room by using the clever sliding doors to hide the kitchen. Using pocket doors helps to save space and provides the openness of a traditional dining room.

<strong>Use Natural light</strong>

Use natural light to create a lively and bright dining experience. It adds class and an elegant style statement. Use a set of English wing chairs to add to the enticing experience. Using canvas upholstery helps to add class and design to the chairs. Mix up the upholstery fabrics to create a textural depth to chairs. Use natural materials as possible to reflect nature in your creation from overhead carved beams to rustic furniture chairs.

<strong>Make a smaller space look larger</strong>

Ideally, you can use a round table surrounded with palette single coloured chairs to visually expand the dining space. It is a remarkable idea to create a green airy atmosphere even though you have a small space to decorate your dining room. Use vertical lines to enhance the height of your room. Also using large floor to ceiling windows can create the perfect large dining space.

<strong>Use your space efficiently</strong>

If you are someone short of space, try to use a built in banquette seating arrangement. You can add seating space beneath the banquette for storage. Use fabric to mix the seating very well.

Use a traditional foundation and mix it with some truly unexpected colour blends to create a masterpiece.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Does Size Matter for an Affordable House?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Majority of the home buyers in metros and big cities look for affordable properties to purchase, and this is especially true if they are first time buyers. For first time buyers, what matters most is to find a property that is affordable, with good amenities and is in close vicinity of their work place. While the size is surely important, it is not paid much heed as other priorities and aspirations of the home buyers override this aspect of affordable properties. No wonder that many new real estate projects, especially in tier 1 and tier 2 cities are melodramatically smaller than the average size of homes in India. Also, it must be mentioned that there is huge demand for affordable 1 and 2BHK houses, and apartments across cities.

Given below are some points that supersede the shortcomings of smaller homes:

<strong>Opportunity of living in one‚Äôs own home</strong>

Houses and apartments of smaller size are affordable and within the budget of many middle class families. Many buyers see these properties as a way to enter the property market and to get away from the shackles of rentals. In most cases, the EMIs of smaller properties are not more than the monthly rental of many apartments or houses in prime localities, and hence is considered as a better option by many; the best part is that people get to live in their dream ‚Äòown‚Äô house, even if it means living in a house of smaller size.

<strong>Smaller homes are easier to maintain, and hence are preferred by many</strong>

Bigger the house, bigger are the maintenance issues and demands associated with the home. If you are on a tight monthly budget, then moving into a smaller house will help you save money, especially as the maintenance charges of smaller properties are very low when compared to bigger properties. All this while you enjoy the same amenities that are enjoyed by the people who own bigger properties in the same community. Even if you are considering the purchase of a small individual house that is within your budget, you will be glad to know that it will have much lower maintenance needs than bigger properties.

<strong>Smaller homes encourage family bonding</strong>

And for those of you who are still apprehensive about living in smaller homes, it is good to know that smaller homes encourage family bonding much better than bigger homes. Social interaction is more in smaller homes and this is one reason many prefer to live in small houses, especially if they are a nuclear family.

<strong>Smaller homes cut the urge to buy and accumulate</strong>

People who live in small houses do not think much about purchasing furniture or decorating it with exorbitant accessories, and hence save a lot of money. Think about it, how many people living in a small house would consider investing in something like a treadmill; needless to mention, that many people who live in bigger houses spend much on these items, but hardly use it.

There are many advantages of purchasing smaller affordable houses; however, the most important one is that smaller homes are much easier to sell. Affordable housing has a much wider sales market which facilitates you to dispose your small house fast and easy. So, when you have the resources and the will to purchase a bigger house, selling a smaller property is very easy and can also help you reap great real estate gains.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Clever Storage Solutions for Rental Properties</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=52063</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Living in rented properties may not always restrict you to limited storage facilities. There are many ways and means to innovate using existing facilities to provide handy solutions for all your storage needs.

Most rented flats do not feature adequate space for storage. Small cupboards and shelves in kitchens can drive you crazy trying to figure out where to place your utensil, crockery, condiments and the like. Bedroom cabinets are too small for your clothes and there is just about no room for storing items that are not needed for daily living. What does then one do in such a situation? You learn to innovate and adapt.

<strong>Identify the areas of your flat for storage</strong>

The first step is to identify the dimensions of your flat and areas that will hold storage shelves and cupboards without upsetting the aesthetics of the interiors. For example kitchen corners are excellent spaces for putting up corner shelves. These are space savers and do not interfere in room space. A set of four or more corner shelves can easily hold your kitchen condiments. Even if your kitchen doesn‚Äôt feature a pantry, you just make yourself one. An old bookshelf can be touched up with a coat of paint or varnish and designed as an open pantry for all your crockery and kitchen items. If the shelf is wide enough, hooks can be screwed onto the edges to hang coffee mugs and ladles.

Once you have identified the areas that can be used for holding storage solutions, you can start by implementing the same. The amount of stuff you possess may have items that have no value like old drawers or even cartons and cardboard boxes. These are excellent means of storing items like knick knacks, books, and paraphernalia that are used infrequently. Cardboard boxes can be painted in contrasting colours and placed in a corner of the room. You can also purchase cheap storage units like mini drawers and shelves and use these effectively.

<strong>Use fabric</strong>

Wardrobe solutions are easily available online. If you are on a tight budget and wooden assembled wardrobes are a bit expensive, you can opt for space saving fabric wardrobes. These consist of strong fabric and are closed with a large zipper. The unit contains a lightweight metallic rod where hangars can be placed for your clothes. Similar to fabric wardrobes are fabric shoe shelves which work as a similar utility. The advantage of using fabric storage is mobility, where it can be easily removed and placed anywhere you like.

<strong>Multipurpose furniture are excellent space savers</strong>

If you have a compact flat that doesn‚Äôt offer you the luxury of separate rooms for different living purposes, then your bedroom can double as a living room with ease. All you need to do is purchase sofa cum beds. These take up minimum space and simultaneously provide ample sleeping provision for one or two persons. If you do have a decent sized bedroom, then placing a double bed with built-in storage facilities makes sense. With a box bed you acquire a large amount of storage space for storing extra curtains, bed linen or even your clothes. A bed featuring a showcase cabinet or shelves at the head stand provides storage for books and a place for a reading light, bedside alarms, etc.

If you have kids around, then do not discard your old buckets or tubs for that matter. Having kids means toys, books, games and the works. Old buckets can be used for storing toys and games. Tubs can be stacked in a neat formation for holding clothes, shoes and bedding.

<strong>Use hooks of all sizes</strong>

When you live in a rented space then one small utility will make a big difference in your life, for example, hooks in varying styles and sizes. A set of multipurpose hooks or a row of connected hooks placed behind doors in all rooms can be used for clothes. Adhesive type hooks are advisable as they are easily placed anywhere you choose. As long as you adapt there will always be a solution for living in rented spaces.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Hardwood Vs Look-alike Porcelain</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=52066</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hardwood floors have been around for a long time, but they last only for a brief period. Water and scratches can damage hardwood floors, and therefore, they need costly attention from time to time. There have been advances in the tile industry to produce a close relative to wood tiles that don‚Äôt have the same problems we are facing with hard wood. These tiles offer wood like grains/lines and carry all the beauty of a striking hardwood, with the qualities and performance that you would love to have in your tile.

Designers have constantly floated the idea of wooden floors being preferred to porcelain tiles. People love wooden floors as they are sophisticated, timeless and blend with all kinds of d√©cor. They are easy to maintain and follow design trends.

Floors engineered with hardwood or porcelain tiles are both versatile and are superior in finish and quality over solid wood flooring. Porcelain tiles are much affordable over solid wood floors and with the new technology, it allows for wood like finish and win in all departments of quality, finish, lifestyle as well as price. Today, digital images are quite advanced and the products made from these optical technologies are very real and lasting. This new technology allows manufacturers to add a variety of textures, grains and distress to make it so appealing. However, you long for a classical finish and life, then solid wood floor is the best option for you.

<strong>Solid hardwood</strong>

You pay a little more but get the best gold standard available in the market today. It has tradition and lasts for generations. Solid wood is highly resistant to heat, humidity and temperatures. They are rugged, sustainable and are environmentally green. They can be refurbished, sand papered, retouched with different shades and polishes and restored many times. Grey tones and wide plank oak boards are quite popular today. The only disadvantage is that they are priced higher, they can be accommodated everywhere as they need to have a base to install them over concrete and stone surfaces. Also we need to take care of routine maintenance as this needs careful attention and care.

<strong>Porcelain tile</strong>

It is not wooden flooring but is durable, clean, a new fresh look every time and has different textures and designs. They are scratch proof and also can with stand high humidity conditions. They are highly recommended as they are tougher than ceramic tiles and normally come in rectangular shapes, don't fade and never needs to be retouched. The technology of the porcelain title can be replicated on every bit of porcelain and this means you can have a uniform, exotic wood finish at a very reasonable price. They can last for decades and can be used in basements, laundry, sports complexes and also at homes. They cost less than most solid wood floors, but the disadvantage is that they require careful installation. Additionally, if you have damaged a single tile over the years, the entire stretch of the floor needs to be redone or else the flaws could show up.

Another decent option is Vinyl wood flooring, which is not typical wood but is digital imprint of a wood laminate on a surface. They are water resistant and can be used in bathrooms and kitchens and also laundry areas. Based on digital photography at higher resolutions, this technology looks very real and it is easy to install and can be done by yourself. The only down side is that they always feel very unnatural and resemble synthetic finish.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Prefabricated Houses in India</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Traditional construction with bricks and mortar is giving way to new technologies like pre-fabricated construction materials which helps to meet the demands of the affordable homes as much as 27 million units and also to address the shortage of human resources. Using this new technology, cost effective homes can be built quickly and can help benefit builders from restricting them to borrow money at steep interest rates.

<strong>Pre-fab homes that can be assembled at site</strong>

Stores offer a variety of home accessories with pre-fabricated or newer and more advanced technologies coming into the home domain. Today, pre-fab or customized homes are becoming a reality. New technology uses factory-made components that can be assembled at the site and can be done in much less time and is affordable. Some of the commonly used materials are wooden panels, windows frames, panels with PVC and steel frames for structures, gypsum and other related items for custom building your floor, factory or machine pressed doors and frames. For major projects having an overall load of 500 flats or more, modules are structure cast at the factory and then brought to the site and assembled.

<strong>Technique used in pre-fab homes</strong>

A dry walled technique is useful when you are building terrace blocks and walls, steel frames and plaster sheets. Using architectural software, the entire building can be custom made and later the components such as ceiling panels, floor tiles, wall panels and steel frames can be successfully made and put together in one place. Homes which have multiple stories and without the support of pillars and beams can be also assembled at the site using steel frames for support. Using conventional techniques, inside partitioning and quick interiors designing can be carried out using pre-fabricated materials.

<strong>These can be assembled at site are ready to use within hours</strong>

Today, designers and engineers are using concrete false walls and panels to create partition between rooms like the ones you normally do with Lego toy blocks. Additionally, kitchen and bathroom units are being assembled as separate units with full plumbing and electrical systems. They are put into place at the site and ready for use within hours. To improve the quality of the building and to reduce time on construction, designers are more steadily using pre-fabricated construction materials to help them achieve this new design concept. Pre-fabricated materials are a bit expensive, 15-20 per cent more in cost compared to traditional building materials, but help to reduce labour costs, improve the life span of the building structure and saves time. They also reduce supplementary finishing works like plastering, wiring and plumbing activities to a large extent.

<strong>Pre-fab homes are an affordable housing option</strong>

The ideology to offer affordable homes for housing in big metropolitan cities in the country is a major challenge. Residential land is less available for construction and using traditional building practices, builders cannot achieve their goal to provide for the large urban Indian population without a major contest. Today, the concept of designing your entire home in a factory and assembling it at the construction site is a new housing solution. This concept could target buyers with an affordable cost of Rs 9,500-12,000 per square meter.

<strong>Pre-fab homes are durable and long lasting</strong>

Based on modular designs, homes can be easily expanded according to the needs of the domestic buyer. Today an average 100 square meter house can be assembled at the site within six weeks and the concept has the ability to suit the needs and requirements of most home buyers. Interior temperatures can be maintained using natural ventilation and solar powered systems. It also incorporates technologies such as rain water harvesting and sustainable recycling of water. If you are a potential investor, you can save considerably by buying these custom made homes over traditional building solutions. Stricter norms and conditions are applied to factory based pre-fabricated homes and therefore the life spans of such homes are over 35-50 years on an average. They use cutting edge technology to reduce the manufacturing defects and have strong quality checks to guarantee the sturdiness of structures.

<strong>You can purchase pre-fab custom made homes online</strong>

One can buy these pre-fabricated custom made homes online. Since this a pretty new concept in India, there are very few companies in India that manufacture pre-fab homes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RBI.jpeg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-33359" style="margin: 1px 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="RBI Cuts Repo Rates, Developers Welcome Move" alt="RBI" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/RBI.jpeg" width="280" height="216" /></a><span style="color: #993300;"><em>The wait is finally over. </em></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">In a much anticipated monetary review policy, Reserve Bank Governor Raghuram Rajan today cut the repo rate by 25 basis points to 7.25 per cent. In the backdrop of marked slowdown, the move has come across as big relief for the industry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">This is the third time in the current fiscal that the central bank has slashed the interest rates. Following RBI‚Äôs decision, commercial banks are most likely to slash interest rates on <a title="Home Loan" href="http://www.commonfloor.com/services/home-loan" target="_blank">home loans</a> soon.¬†</span><span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, the cash reserve ratio, which is the amount of money banks have to keep with the RBI, was left unchanged at 4 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As expected, following the decision, State Bank of India (SBI) ¬†reduced their interest rates on home loans by 15 basic points. The new rates are pegged at 9.70 per cent as opposed to 9.85 per cent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Industry Reaction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Welcoming the move, Pradeep Jain, Chairman, Parsvnath Developers Ltd. says, ‚ÄòWe were expecting the move considering the realty sector has been struggling since last few quarters with increasing inventories and low demands. We hope that more banks will now pass on the benefit to customers thereby stimulating the overall demand. Such liberal moves coupled with policy reforms are necessary for the revival of the real estate sector in our country.‚Äù</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Reiterating the same,¬†Manoj Gaur, MD, Gaursons India Ltd says that ‚Äòwith this move, stakeholders are now expecting the sales to improve as more potential customers will think of buying homes as the interest¬†rates¬†will be reduced. Now we have to wait and see that when will the banks and Home loan providers will reduce the interest¬†rate.‚Äù</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">With weakening rupee and core sector index shrinking to 0.4 percent in the month of April, this move by RBI shows aggressive decision making which will be very crucial for the upcoming months. Reiterating the same, Deepak Kapoor, President CREDAI ‚Äì Western U.P. &amp; Director Gulshan Homz says, ‚Äòthe move was much anticipated as well with manufacturing sector bouncing back riding with a strong domestic demand along with slowing inflation. For the real estate sector, this is good news as key rate cut by RBI means interest rates can be declined further by banks which directly decreases the burden from the customers.‚Äô</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">After the last RBI policy, the demand in the real estate sector had kick started with banks reducing their lending rates. ‚ÄòWith a further reduction in repo rate now, the demand graph will see a positive growth in the upcoming months,‚Äô opines Kushagr Ansal, Director, Ansal Housing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;">Anticipating rate cut by banks, Praveen Tyagi, CMD, VVIP says, ‚ÄòBanks now need to cut their interest rates further so that the demand and investment in the real estate is pushed; and purchasing power of the consumers is enha</span>nced.‚Äô</p>
Showing discontent, R.K Arora, Chairman, Supertech Limited says, ‚Äòthe¬†announcement to cut the repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points by RBI¬†is¬†not sufficient¬†although it is an indication of positive approach of RBI towards investment in the country, and <a title="Real Estate" href="http://www.commonfloor.com" target="_blank">Real Estate</a> Industry welcomes it.‚Äô

Elaborating on the same, he says, ‚Äòthe Industry was seeking a cut of 1% interest rate to¬†bring back confidence in home buyers and investors, to provide a comfortable EMI level and to kick-start demand.¬†The¬†need of the hour is to reduce the cost of funding in real estate which only would bring in more investment and create more job and the RBI has not addressed this crucial issue.‚Äô

Sharing same views, Gaurav Gupta, General Secretary, CREDAI-RNE says,<b>¬†'</b>I would say that more interest rate cuts are needed if we want to see people realizing their dreams of buying homes for self-use.<b>‚Äù</b>

<strong>Effect on Home Loans</strong>

Explaining the impact on home loan rates, Rishi Meha, co-founder of deal4loans.com says, 'At the starting of the year RBI repo rate was at 8%. Now, RBI has reduced the repo rate 3 times in past 5 months. In January, repo rate was cut by 25 base points, In March it was further reduced by 25 base points to 7.5% and now it has been cut to 7.25%. So the repo rate has reduced by 0.75% in this year thus, far. However, home loan interest rates have been changed only once. In April, all major Home loan banks and corporations reduced their lowest home loan interest rates from 10.1% - 9.85%. We believe, due to RBI's monetary policies bank's hands are a bit forced to reduce interest rates and home loan interest rates will fall by at least 0.25% in the immediate future.'

The stretch between Nayandanahalli to NICE Ring Road Junction, popularly known as Mysore Road, has become a real estate hot spot in the last couple of years. Connectivity and growth of infrastructure are the key factors driving real estate growth in localities in and around Mysore Road.

<b>Key Physical Infrastructure Projects</b>

Mysore Road has a lot of things going for it right now for the potential buyers. According to CommonFloor data, the following infrastructure projects are expected to provide the area major connectivity and further augment real estate growth.
<ul>
	<li>Metro Phase I and II are giving a major impetus to real estate growth in the region. Reach 2 of the Metro will bring Kengeri closer to the city and open up several economical residential options for people.</li>
	<li>The extension of the NICE Road will ultimately connect with Mysore.</li>
	<li>The proposed elevated expressway will ensure connectivity unlike ever before.</li>
	<li>The proposed Cauvery Water Supply Phase 3 project will consequently ensure a great water supply for the region.</li>
</ul>
<b>Key Social Infrastructure Projects </b>

<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/mysore-road-bangalore/rvp-4f044553cb026">Mysore Road</a> has a lot to offer as far as social infrastructure is concerned. The stretch boasts of good social infrastructure developments and is a self-sustaining region with renowned hospitals, schools and entertainment facilities.

<b>Educational Institutions:</b>¬† Some of the key schools in the area include St Joseph Boys High School, Orchid‚Äôs International School, BM Valley School, Manipal Tattva School and Hillrock National Public School.

<b>Medical Institutions: </b>The area is home to well-known hospitals like Mysore Hi-Tech Hospital, Sri Maruti Nursing Home, Joshi Hospital and Balaji Hospital.

<b>Retail &amp; Commercial Spaces: </b>Mysore Road has several retail hubs such as Gopalan Legacy Mall, Total Hypermarket and Bangalore Central.

<b>Major Challenges </b>

With growth and development come challenges and Mysore Road is also plagued by some civic and developmental issues. These include:
<ul>
	<li>Simultaneous road widening, flyover construction and Metro construction have resulted in several roads being congested and traffic getting clogged.</li>
	<li>Garbage disposal is also a perennial problem in the area.</li>
	<li>What a potential investor must keep in mind is that the proposed infrastructural development can take years to complete ‚Äì development of the NICE road connecting Bangalore and Mysore has been mired in delays for years now.</li>
	<li>The Metro too has overshot its time frame and may take a while. Most of the developers in this area have gotten in with the understanding that overall infrastructural development will take approximately 4-5 years to be in place and they are in for the long haul.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Road-.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-33134" style="margin: 1px 10px; border: 1px solid black;" alt="Road" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Road--300x160.jpg" width="300" height="160" /></a>The ambitious coastal road from Mumbai's Nariman Point to Kandivali in the Western suburbs will soon be reality. The government has granted environment clearance for a 35-km coastal road project to connect north and south Mumbai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Ministry of Environment and Forests, headed by Prakash Javadekar, has granted clearance to the Rs 8,500- crore project that involves coast reclamation. The 35.6 km project between <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/nariman-point-mumbai/rvp-52c2592d530c8">Nariman Point</a> and Kandivali, along the western seafront, is likely to begin in mid-August. The project will help in decongesting Mumbai roads and create 91 hectares of green space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, the coastal stretch will be developed for tourists. The draft notification will be issued by June 15 and the final notification by August 15, and the state government, along with BMC, will finance the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Catalyst in decongesting traffic</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The road, considered integral to plans for transforming the Mumbai into a world-class city, has been hanging fire for over three years now. Planned as a freeway to connect south <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/mumbai-city">Mumbai</a> to the western suburbs through a high-speed corridor, the project was first taken up by former Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan as a cheaper alternative to sea links for decongesting vehicular traffic in Mumbai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 35-km coastal road was stalled because the state wants to reclaim 110 hectares of land for the road which is against the current provisions of the environmental laws. Current rules prohibit reclaiming land from the sea for road projects. With its focus on clearing infrastructure bottlenecks in the city, the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government had sought Union environment ministry's clearance for the road proposal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The clearance for the Mumbai coastal road that is expected to considerably de-congest the city, has come with conditions that will ensure coastal and marine life are not hit by the project. Among the conditions proposed are that there will be minimum reclamation of coastal land, no commercial activity to be permitted on reclaimed land and the project should stay clear of the high tide line. The Maharashtra government has agreed to the conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to experts, the construction of the coastal road is imperative to decongest traffic and would transform Mumbai into a world-class city. It is also being said that environmental concerns with regard to reclaiming land have been exaggerated and it is in Mumbai's interest to build the coastal road. Dotted by promenades, open spaces, cycling tracks and a view of the sea, the road will be uninterrupted by traffic signals. Motorists may be able to zip across the stretch in 45 minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dutch technical support for infra projects</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier last week, the Maharashtra government had signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of Netherlands for technical support to develop the Mumbai coastal road and Metro rail projects. A project report on combining the 35-km coastal road between Nariman Point, <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/kandivali-east-mumbai/rvp-52c25651ecafc">Kandivali </a>and the Mumbai Metro-III Colaba-Bandra-Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone corridor would be ready in three months with the help of experts from the Netherlands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The coastal road is part of the Rs 60,000-crore transport infrastructure projects being undertaken by the state government.</p>]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Smart City Kochi to Be Launched in July</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-cities.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-51738 alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Smart City Kochi to be Launched in July" alt="smart cities" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/smart-cities-300x161.jpg" width="300" height="161" /></a>Kochi, the financial capital of Kerala is an important port city in the western coast of India. It is expected to be developed as a smart city by the Kerala government, in accordance with the centre‚Äôs ‚Äò100 smart cities‚Äô dream project. The dream of developing the Kochi smart city will soon be realised with the Phase-I of Smart City Kochi <strong>(SCK)</strong> set to be launched in July this year.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Smart City Kochi (SCK)</strong></span>

The first phase of Smart City Kochi (SCK) is jointly promoted by TECOM Investments, which is a subsidiary of Government of Kerala and Dubai Holding. SCK has setup an IT/ITeS SEZ (special economic zone) in a built-up area of about 13 million sq. ft. This houses offices of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector, finance, media, research and innovation clusters. The first phase will bring out a supply of about 6,50,00 sq. ft. of built-up area and a floor space of more than 1,00,000 sq. ft.

SCK is expected to be the single largest job provider in Kerala with about 90,000 jobs by 2020. The first phase is expected to generate about 6,000 jobs in the IT sector. The project is conceived as an integrated digital smart city.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Other factors supporting smart city development</strong></span>

Apart from being a port city, Kochi is a key contributor to Kerala‚Äôs economy. It is also home to the International Pepper Exchange and Indian Navy‚Äôs Southern Naval Command. IT and ITeS sectors have been driving the growth of the city in a significant way. Several business parks are already present in the city. They include Cochin SEZ, KINFRA Export Promotion Industrial Park and InfoPark. The InfoPark houses nearly 120 major IT companies, with more than 30,000 professionals working here. Kochi also has other thriving industries.

Kochi has great connectivity with other Indian cities as well as Sri Lanka. Several national and state highways run through the city. Kochi houses an international airport. The first phase of Kochi metro connecting the length and breadth of the city is already under way. The state government is also working on improving the city‚Äôs infrastructure.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Real estate scenario</strong></span>

Kochi currently offers several multi-storeyed <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/kochi-apartments" target="_blank">apartments in Kochi</a>, independent houses and builder floor apartments. The city also witnesses regular launch of apartment projects due to its continued growth and growth in demand for housing. Approximate <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/kochi-city" target="_blank">property prices in Kochi</a> are in the range of Rs 3,700-5,900 per sq. ft. Edapally has been continuously witnessing growth in property prices owing to the upcoming metro. With the emergence of SCK, the demand for housing and hence, the real estate prospects in the city are sure to go up.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Kozhikode May Miss Smart City Bus</strong></span>

Kozhikode, an important city in Kerala and a proposed smart city by the government of Kerala may miss the ‚ÄòSmart city‚Äô bus. This is majorly due to the failure of the civic body to make efforts to meet the criteria laid down by the central government for selecting a smart city and send the report. The government of Kerala has also chosen Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Thrissur Corporations as well as Malappuram and Kannur municipalities. Malappuram has already submitted a report in this regards. All these towns and cities were selected by the state government as their development has been showing continuous urban character.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tumkur-1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-44514" title="Real Estate in Bangalore" alt="Tumkur 1" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Tumkur-1.jpg" width="280" height="150" /></a>With the city extending towards new peripheries, real estate development in Bangalore has also grown to accommodate the requirements of a burgeoning working population. Many companies are going beyond the Central Business Districts (CBDs) to set up shop thereby generating employment opportunities. Additionally, viable physical and social infrastructure has come up in these far-flung areas further augmenting real estate growth. Three major peripheral areas around Bangalore that have grown into prominence are - Mysore Road in the West, Yelahanka and Dodaballapur Road in the North and Old Madras Road in the East.

<b>Mysore Road</b>

The stretch between Nayandanahalli to NICE Ring Road Junction, popularly referred as Mysore Road, has become a <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/bangalore-city" target="_blank">real estate hotspot in Bangalore</a>. NICE corridor, proximity to outer Ring Road and Metro Phase I and II are giving a major boost to realty growth.

With ample land available for future development, prices are comparatively cheaper on this stretch.¬† According to CommonFloor data,<b> </b>the average price of layouts and plots projects within the NICE Ring Road towards Bangalore is around Rs 3,650 per sq ft whereas the average price of layouts and plots beyond the NICE Ring Road towards Mysore is said to be Rs 1,150 per sq ft. Maximum apartment projects launched in the last three years were in the range of Rs 3,000-5,000 per sq ft belonging to the affordable to mid segment.

<b>Yelahanka and Dodaballapur</b>

In the Northern periphery of the city, Yelahanka and <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/doddaballapur-road-bangalore/lvp-cvqmsd" target="_blank">Dodaballapur Road</a> have been gaining a lot of momentum. One of the major factors that have pushed the real estate market here is the extensive 6-lane highway that connects Bangalore city to the airport. The completion of the metro rail will also boost the connectivity. Apart from this, the location has a well-built infrastructure including good hospitals, restaurants, educational institutes and other such facilities.

<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/yelahanka-bangalore/rvp-4f06fd7c57855">Property prices in Yelahanka</a><b>¬†</b>are also quite reasonable here despite the presence of IT companies. The location is witnessing expansion in both commercial as well as residential real estate. Right from affordable housing to high-end projects, all kind of residential projects are available on this stretch.

<b>Old Madras Road</b>

In the Eastern region, Old Madras Road (OMR) has become an attractive destination for real estate growth. Residential catchments in the vicinity are localities off OMR- Budigere and Kadugudi.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rental.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-47983 alignleft" title="Apartments for rent in Powai" alt="Rental" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Rental-300x218.jpg" width="300" height="218" /></a>Mumbai, the financial capital of India, witnesses a significant demand for rental housing. Most of this demand is from families living close to the industrial areas or working in the key Central Business Districts (CBDs) of the city. The city also witnesses a high demand from the migrant population working in the city.

Several suburbs in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) cater to this rental demand in the city. According to a recent research by CommonFloor, Powai appears as one of the top rental destinations in MMR.

Here‚Äôs a snapshot.

<strong>What‚Äôs Available?</strong>

Most of the available units for rent in the suburb are 1, 2, 3 and <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/mumbai-property/in-powai-a3004/for-rent/apartment-ht/4-bhk" target="_blank">4BHK flats in Powai</a>. The following table gives an idea about the average rent for different configurations in the suburb.

</table>
</div>
Rentals in the suburb are on the higher end due to the posh quotient of the suburb. <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/apartments-for-rent-in-powai/cfri-52c26d9492b75" target="_blank">Apartments in Powai</a> can also fetch you healthy returns. The current rental yield is 3.5 per cent.

<strong>Why Powai?</strong>

A north-eastern suburb, Powai is a posh locality located on the banks of Powai Lake. Factors driving rental demand are:

¬∑ Presence of Kensington SEZ, which is an IT SEZ, and the IIT-Mumbai. The suburb has been dubbed as Mumbai‚Äôs startup hub in recent times.

¬∑ Important roads offering connectivity and accessibility to the suburb include Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road (JVLR) and LBS (Lal Bahadur Shastri) Marg. The Eastern Express Highway (EEH), which connects the eastern suburbs, passes close to Powai.

¬∑ The Eastern Freeway was opened to public in two phases in 2013 and 2014 respectively, which has significantly improved the area‚Äôs connectivity with <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/mumbai-south-mumbai/zvp-52c0f749c8c95" target="_blank">South Mumbai</a>.

¬∑ Regular BEST and A/C buses. Availability of auto-rickshaws within the locality.

¬∑ Powai has a completely developed infrastructure with several commercial and business hubs, parks, educational institutions and hospitals, and a lake. The suburb has good environment.

¬∑ About 5 km from the city‚Äôs International Airport and less than 5 km from Andheri SEEPZ SEZ.

Thus, if you are looking to stay in a rental apartment in a well-connected suburb with excellent infrastructure and proximity to key educational as well as business institutions, then Powai definitely deserves a visit!]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Andheri West Witnesses Increasing Interest in New Properties</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Housing-society-concept-of-mutuality.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-45683 alignleft" alt="" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Housing-society-concept-of-mutuality-300x214.jpg" width="300" height="214" /></a>Andheri West has been considered one of the most posh areas in Mumbai in recent years. Being the western zone of Andheri suburb, the area witnessed focussed development from the beginning. Several factors have contributed to the area‚Äôs growth as a posh area since then. The area caters more to the affluent population of the country. As such, it offers a limited number of new <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/andheri-west-/rvp-52c24d1a8bcc2">residential properties in Andheri West</a>, focused more towards the higher net worth individuals (HNIs). However, according to a recent report by CommonFloor, the area has witnessed an interesting trend of an increasing availability of residential units during the last three years, indicating an increased interest in properties here. Year 2014 witnessed almost an increase of 45 per cent in the number of units being launched.

<span style="color: #993300;"><em><strong>Snapshot of market trends</strong></em></span>

<strong>Available Unit Type:</strong> Most of the residential units launched over the last three years are multi-storeyed apartments in the area. Due to the limited land availability and skyrocketing property prices in the area, most of the erstwhile bungalows have been redeveloped into apartments.

<strong>BHK Configuration:</strong> Andheri West offers a significant number of 2 and 3BHK units. Almost half of the available new units are 2BHK apartments, with one third of the new units being <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/mumbai-property/in-andheri-west-a2542/for-sale/apartment-ht/3-bhk">3BHK units in Andheri West</a>. The remaining are <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/mumbai-property/in-andheri-west-a2542/for-sale/apartment-ht/1-bhk" target="_blank">1BHK apartments in Andheri West</a>.

<strong>Approximate budget:</strong> One may find a property in the area over a wide range of budget, starting from Rs 60 lakh (mid-segment) and going beyond Rs 2 crore (ultra-luxury segment). According to the CommonFloor data, the mid-segment, luxury and ultra-luxury segments offered properties in equal percentage.

<strong>Price:</strong> The weighted average price (WAP) of new projects in the area was about Rs 19,000 per sq. ft during Q1, 2015.

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5em;">Key Drivers of Growth</strong></span>

- Focused development of the area as a residential area, leading to good growth in civic and social infrastructure.

- Proximity to posh localities such as <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/bandra-east-mumbai/rvp-52c24ea36ebed" target="_blank">Bandra</a>, <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/khar-west-mumbai/rvp-52c258304072e" target="_blank">Khar</a> and <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/juhu-/rvp-52c25e9a65880" target="_blank">Juhu</a>. The availability of all upscale social amenities improve the deluxe quotient of the area.

- Proximity to important business hubs such as Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and SEEPZ SEZ. Also proximity to the Mumbai International Airport as well as Juhu beach.

- Excellent connectivity to all the major areas of Mumbai via road and rail. The connectivity and traffic conditions have improved in the recent past due to the new metro line and Sahar Elevated Road in proximity to the area. A few more infrastructure projects are in pipeline.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>NCR Now 2.28 Times bigger than Washington Metropolitan Area</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong><span style="color: #993300;"><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NewNCRBoundaryPNG.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-51780" title="NCR Area 2.28 % bigger than Washington Metropolitan Area" alt="New NCR Boundary" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/NewNCRBoundaryPNG.png" width="389" height="409" /></a>The National Capital Region (NCR) is all set to get bigger.</span></strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the decision to include Jind and Karnal districts of Haryana and Muzaffarnagar district of UP, the city boundaries are set to expand. This big decision came into light at the 35th meeting of the National Capital Region Planning Board (<strong>NCRPB</strong>), which was headed by Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, chairman of the NCRPB. With this, <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/delhi-ncr-city" target="_blank">Delhi NCR</a> now has a total of 23 districts covering a total area of about 51,109 km2. While if we look at Washington's metropolitan area, it stands at just 15,540 km2*.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.5em;">What is Haryana Demanding?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Speedy Completion of 3 Proposed Dams:</span> </strong>The Haryana CM urged the board to take up the matter of three proposed dams of Renuka, Kishau and Lakhwar on the Yamuna and its tributaries with the Centre for their speedy completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>How will it help:</strong> </span>Once completed, it is expected to resolve the problem of acute water shortage in Delhi and some districts of Haryana to a certain extent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>International Airport at Hisar:</strong> </span>the second demand put forward is to get an in-principle approval for setting up an alternate international Airport at <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/hisar-city" target="_blank">Hisar</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>How will it help:</strong></span> It is expected to provide maintenance and repair operations (<strong>MRO</strong>) facilities for the aircraft in the northern part of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Alignment of 3 RRTS Corridors:</strong></span> For swift connectivity within the <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/delhi-ncr-city" target="_blank">NCR</a>, the Haryana CM also asked for alignment of three Regional Rapid Transit System (<strong>RRTS</strong>) corridors - Delhi-Gurgaon-Rewari-Alwar (<strong>DGRA</strong>), Delhi-Sonipat-Panipat (<strong>DSP</strong>) and Delhi-Gaziabad-Meerut (<strong>DGM</strong>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>How will it help:</strong></span> It will enhance inter-region connectivity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Funding:</strong> </span>Since these projects are of national importance, a request was made to the Union Government to fully fund these projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What‚Äôs More?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure preservation, the state of Haryana has agreed to demarcate 500-metre buffer zone for the protection of Mangar Bani green cover at Mangar village in <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/faridabad-city" target="_blank">Faridabad</a> district. Thus, no construction will happen in this zone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Will inclusion of distant towns help?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering NCR‚Äôs population growth, to meet the growing housing demand, expansion looks imperative. However, just adding more districts won‚Äôt be of much help until and unless requisite infrastructure is developed. If implemented properly, more investment regions will open up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, in the absence of proper planning, developers might just start hoarding land in these place, which will just led to speculative price rise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Important Timelines</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Picture1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-51767" style="border: 1px solid black; margin-top: 1px; margin-bottom: 1px;" alt="Picture1" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Picture1-1024x740.png" width="717" height="518" /></a></p>

				<title>Bangalore: 4 Traditional Areas that Are Still Shoppers‚Äô Haven</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Much before the organized self-sufficient localities of modern day Bangalore came into being, there were market places around which communities placed themselves. These markets provided residents every conceivable household requirement and in many cases went much beyond that as well. Today, these markets continue thrive and have their loyal patrons. They in fact, form the basis of the identity of a locality. Here is a look at some of them:

<strong><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jaynagar.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-51790 alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Flats in Jayanagar 4th Block" alt="Jaynagar" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jaynagar-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Jayanagar 4th Block:</strong> For the residents of Jayanagar, there is nothing that can beat the variety on offer at the <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/jayanagar-/rvp-4f069e8938be7">Jayanagar 4th block</a> market complex. Spread over 15,000sqt and designed by Sundaram Architects, this shopping complex has everything you need segregated neatly.

Considering the expanse over which it is spread, the complex has multiple entrances. The space has dedicated areas on the inside and outside for flowers, fruits, vegetables, household needs, clothes, cosmetics and more. Old school style pop-up stores, or rather vendors who spread out a tarpaulin sheet with their wares make an appearance in the evenings.

Besides the several shops, you also have office space on the higher floors and even a restaurant or two. This ensures that no matter what you step in for, you are going to get what you are looking for and then some. The Jayanagar market services Jayanagar, Yediyur and all its surrounding areas.

<strong><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/KR-Market.jpg"><img class="wp-image-51791 alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="KR Market property" alt="KR Market" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/KR-Market-300x284.jpg" width="270" height="256" /></a>KR Market (Krishna Rajendra Market):</strong> KR Market was recently in the news for two major reasons ‚Äì one was the discovery of a Tipu Sultan era cannon while the digging for the Metro was on and the other for a bundh that was declared by shop owners. This bundh saw the closure of KR Market for the first time since it opened in 1928.

Stepping into KR Market is an assault on all your senses, but in a mesmerizing manner. The flower vendors hawk a riot of colours, the spice and vegetable market are places you can spend an entire day in. It has a thriving wholesale market that facilitates trade for thousands of shops across the city. It is of course an overwhelming experience considering the roads are narrow and crowded. However, it is a place that you will not step out of empty handed. While KR Market technically services most of Bengaluru, it is close to Chamrajpet, Jayanagar VV Puram and Basavangudi.
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Malleshwaram.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-51792 alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Malleshwaram Market" alt="Malleshwaram" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Malleshwaram-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199" /></a>Malleshwaram Market:</strong> Named after the Kaadu Malleshwara temple, this traditional market recently saw a significant portion of it levelled to the ground in the <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/tag/bbmp-bangalore">BBMP‚Äôs </a>efforts to build a modern complex in¬†<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/malleshwaram-bangalore/rvp-4f06fd7971d87">Malleshwaram</a>. However, there is a still a great deal of charm left in this beautiful market. The flower market has always taken centre-stage here, being placed right in the forefront. Much like all the other markets around, this too has been a repository of goods that ensures the residents of the area get everything they need in one place, just like generations before them did.</p>
<strong><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chickpet.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-51793 alignright" style="margin: 1px 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="Chickpete Market" alt="Chickpet" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chickpet-300x199.jpg" width="270" height="179" /></a></strong>

<strong>Chickpete:</strong> For the keen shopping enthusiast, who loves a good bargain, Chickpete is a veritable gold mine. The labyrinthine roads are home to stores that house some of the best bargains to be had. Great bargains do not mean you are settling for something of inferior quality here though. From handmade zari materials to sarees, to sweetmeats, shoes, clothes, and every possible electrical and electronic goods, Chickpete has something in store for every kind of shopper. For those looking for great deals on jewellery ‚Äì both cosmetic and real, <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/chickpet-bangalore/rvp-4e71a183367f5" target="_blank">Chickpete</a> has rows of shops that have been in the business for generations. The Sunday Flea Market and the Fancy Shop are two legendary spaces at Chickpete.

Bangalore‚Äôs traditional markets are quite literally the character of the locality they are based at. Often used to denote a major landmark, you will find that every generation in a family has a shop or vendor that they are loyal to.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Affordable-housing.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-47267" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Luxury House in Bangalore" alt="Affordable housing in Bangalore" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Affordable-housing.jpg" width="190" height="126" /></a>Bangalore‚Äôs real estate market has shown remarkable resilience and compared to NCR and MMR it has emerged as one of the strongest centres of growth. The luxury segment in particular has witnessed vigorous activity with many several high-profile launches over the last three years.¬† While the luxury market in Bangalore mainly comprises high-apartments and villas it also includes layouts and <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/plots-for-sale-in-bangalore/cfct-bangalore" target="_blank">plots in Bangalore</a>.¬† The definition of luxury is broad and variable but certain factors such as amenities, connectivity, infrastructure, size, builder and quality of the construction give a property its ‚Äòluxury‚Äô tag.

The pricing of a <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/bangalore-city" target="_blank">luxury property in Bangalore</a> starts at Rs 6,000 per sq ft in upcoming areas and it can go up to Rs 36,000 per sq ft in Central Bangalore. As per CommonFloor data, Central Bangalore has seen highest concentration of luxury units followed by East and North respectively.

<span style="color: #993300;"><b>Reasons for growth</b></span>

The growth of the luxury segment in Bangalore can be attributed to rapid urbanization and the growth of the information technology and financial services sector. Another driving force is the availability of land along with good connectivity to work places such as Outer Ring Road, Whitefield, Sarjapur Road, etc.

Bangalore also boasts of a growing number of high net worth Individuals (HNIs) that have exacting global standards when it comes to choosing a luxury property. Hence, developers are offering exclusive amenities and services along with international brand associations to attract this prime set of buyers.

<span style="color: #993300;"><b>Top Trends in Luxury Market</b></span>

As the luxury housing market continues to grow and prosper in Bangalore, here are some of the key trends that have emerged in this sector:
<ul>
	<li>Despite limited availability of land, Central Bangalore was the centre of luxury housing activity and witnessed almost 80 per cent launches in this segment from 2012 to 2015. According to CommonFloor data, the key markets that saw launches in this zone are Richmond Road, MG Road, Cunningham Road and Vasanth Nagar.</li>
	<li>The rest of the 19 per cent launches in the <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Luxury-Residential-Market-Bangalore-A-CommonFloor-Report.pdf?utm_source=guide%20commonfloor%20survey&amp;utm_medium=pdf%20response&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_campaign=locality%20report%20-%20guide" target="_blank">luxury market in Bangalore</a> were observed in North Bangalore in the same time period. Demand was also observed in East Bangalore, which includes localities such as C V Ramana Nagar, Whitefield, ORR-Sarjapur Road and is driven by the IT/ITeS sectors.</li>
	<li>Hebbal in North Bangalore has emerged as a key micro micro market for luxury housing. It has witnessed maximum number of new launches in the luxury segment, accounting for almost 60 per cent of launches.</li>
</ul>
Kanakpura Road and Banneghatta Road have also witnessed a high number of luxury villas launches. These areas will are expected to see future demand with the development of infrastructure in the form of the NICE Ring Road corridor.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/71.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-38783" title="Villas and Plots in Bangalore" alt="Villament in Bangalore" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/71-300x199.png" width="219" height="145" /></a>Even as metro cities such as NCR and MMR have been grappling with real estate slowdown, the luxury housing market in Bangalore has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Over the last three years, the city has witnessed the growth and development of the luxury sector with constant demand flowing from IT/ITeS professionals and HNIs.

While apartments continue to be the first choice for many buyers, the market for <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/villas-for-sale-in-bangalore/cfct-bangalore" target="_blank">luxury villas in Bangalore</a> and plots has grown substantially in Bangalore. Unlike an apartment, owning a villa or a plot gives the buyer complete ownership of the land. Moreover layouts and plots give the owner the flexibility to construct customized homes. Owing to their growing popularity, developers are coming up with villas and layouts on the outskirts of the city where prices are comparatively low.

<b>Top 5 luxury markets for villas</b>

As per CommonFloor data, the top luxury markets with maximum availability of villas and row houses in the time period from 2012-2015 are

A common feature across all the top 5 luxury markets for villas and row houses is the availability of huge land parcels at a relatively lesser price. This gives developers the chance to offer luxury features and amenities to buyers at a more reasonable price.

Areas such as Sarjapur Road, Whitefield, Kanakpura Road, ORR, OMR and Bannerghatta Road stand out due to good social infrastructure facilities in the form of schools, hospitals, recreation facilities, and retail centres. These areas are likely to get improved connectivity with the upcoming metro and other infrastructure initiatives.

As per CommonFloor data, the top 4 luxury markets in Bangalore with maximum availability of plots and layouts in the time period from 2012-2015 are

Bannerghatta Road and Kanakpura Road in South Bangalore have shown tremendous buoyancy in the market for plots and layouts.¬† Availability of land, strong infrastructure development and presence of the middle-income segment are the key reasons for growth in these areas. The improved connectivity due to the elevated highway, the NICE Road and the planned Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) project has also driven demand for <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/plots-for-sale-in-bannerghatta-road/cfai-bs0jjt" target="_blank">plot in Bannerghatta Road</a>.

As for Yelahanka and Devanahalli in North Bangalore, the availability of large parcels of land along with proximity to the airport has driven the demand for luxury layouts and¬†<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/plots-for-sale-in-bangalore/cfct-bangalore" target="_blank">plots in Bangalore</a>. The Hardware Park and the Aerospace Park coming up in the region will also attract a lot of corporate firms.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Amidst the din and noise of the Maximum City, there are few localities that still bring back the old world charm. The list is a tad limited because of the concretization and commercialization of most heritage areas in Mumbai. However, these areas still retain their charm and are among the most prized addresses in the city.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>1. Malabar Hill</strong></span>

<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shayadri-Bungalow.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-51898 alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Malabar Hill Mumbai" alt="Shayadri Bungalow" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Shayadri-Bungalow-300x168.jpg" width="270" height="151" /></a>Gated communities and luxury apartments may be a rage in Mumbai, but when it comes to a status symbol, nothing quite compares with an independent bungalow in the toniest city neighbourhood. Apart from the grandeur and exclusivity, the big rush lies in the absolute rarity of such properties in South Mumbai. Malabar Hill is home to such exclusive abodes that are acquired by top industrialists, who turn them into residence. Malabar Hill is home to people like the Ruias, Yash Birla and Adi Godrej. Depending on the grade awarded by the heritage committee, structures cannot be knocked down or remodelled. There are FSI limitations on such properties as well. Joint ownership means sometimes a member may not be ready to share costs of refurbishing. But for the buyers, having to shell out a few more crores for restoration is just another additional minor expense to be the pride addressee of Malabar Hill.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>2. Marine Drive</strong></span>

<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kapur-Mahal-Nariman-Point.jpg"><img class="wp-image-51899 alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Marine Drive Mumbai" alt="Kapur Mahal Nariman Point" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Kapur-Mahal-Nariman-Point-300x300.jpg" width="212" height="212" /></a>The art deco buildings along the famous Queen‚Äôs necklace are among the most prized addresses in Mumbai. Marine Drive skirts one of the most beautiful natural bays in the world. Along its length is an array of 5-6 storied buildings designed in the art-deco style of the 1930s, which lends this seaside promenade a unique and unified character. The consistency in character of buildings in details like balconies, compound walls, mass and volume together with the promenade is an integral part of the precinct and creates an interesting urbanscape. This is also a popular tourist destination and one of the most widely used public recreation space of Mumbai city. Most buildings along the iconic stretch have used up most of the FSI available, however open spaces and gymkhanas along the sea face are an integral part of the area's heritage character. The precinct culminates along Girgaum Chowpatty and Wilson College which, despite its mixed architectural features, is able to continue the ambience created by the main part of the precinct.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>3. Fort</strong></span>

<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMAG1574.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-51900 alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Fort in Mumbai" alt="IMAG1574" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/IMAG1574-300x168.jpg" width="270" height="151" /></a>The Fort area of Mumbai is one of the oldest areas of the former Fort. The Fort area was the heart of the city in the 18th century, however, the walls were demolished with the growth of the city. This area is now the financial center of the city, but still has many monuments, and heritage building. Some interesting sights include places of worship like the Parsi Agiarys (Fire Temples), Jain and Hindu temples built right next to churches and cathedrals. The Fort Precinct occupies a significant position in Bombay for it marks the origins of the city. Its highly structured form reinforced by magnificent public buildings makes it architecturally an important and valuable precinct in the city.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>4. Bandra</strong></span>

<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Turner-Road.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-51901 alignright" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Bandra Mumbai" alt="Turner Road" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Turner-Road-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>Bandra, ‚ÄòQueeen of the Suburbs‚Äô is one of the lesser explored but more interesting parts of Mumbai, tempting visitors with its unique mix of history, architecture, traditional ‚Äògaothans‚Äô, Bollywood glamour, and some of the best shopping in the city. The earliest records of Bandra are from the mid-1500‚Äôs, when the Portuguese gave the Jesuit priests the islands of Bandra, Sion, Wadala and Parel. The Portuguese built several churches in Bandra, many of which are still in use today. Bandra remained a village with plantations of rice and vegetables, until it was connected to Mahim by a causeway in 1845. Many <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/villas-for-sale-in-bandra-west/cfri-52c24f2691464" target="_blank">bungalows in Bandra</a> were built here in the boom years of the 1860's and 70's. With the growth and prosperity of Bollywood, Bandra became home to many well-known movie stars. By the mid 1900‚Äôs, Bandra had definitely become a fashionable address, and in recent years, going by the number of new upscale lounges and bars, it seems to have eclipsed the ‚Äòold money‚Äô poshness of South Mumbai. However, in spite of its sea-front houses, bungalows, movie-star homes, restaurants, shopping arcades and clubs, Bandra still retains its old charm.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>5. Aram Nagar, Versova</strong></span>

<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ganesh-Mandir-Aaram-Nagar.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-51902 alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Aram Nagar, Versova" alt="Ganesh Mandir Aaram Nagar" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ganesh-Mandir-Aaram-Nagar-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" /></a>Nestled in the back lanes of busy and affluent lanes of posh Versova in Andheri (West) is the sleepy neighbourhood of Aram Nagar. Once home to British barracks, Aram Nagar is now one of the few, rare localities in Mumbai with bungalows of leisure. Aram Nagar is divided into Parts 1 &amp; 2 and is spread over an area of 40 acres. Today, the occupants of the 300-odd cottages include many photography and casting studios and offices of some of the leading lights of the Hindi film industry. Aram Nagar is one of the few locations in Mumbai where you can meet artists, teachers, yoga experts and NGO workers functioning out of leafy courtyards. The old bungalows with a simple brick structure and asbestos roofs may seem old-fashioned to some but for many they offer the best escape from the anxieties of life in Mumbai.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hrishi-formals1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-40650" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Hrishi Kumar" alt="Hrishi" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hrishi-formals1-199x300.jpg" width="159" height="240" /></a>In what could be a path breaking news for the Indian housing sector; the cabinet has approved launch of ‚ÄòHousing for all by 2022‚Äô programme, which is primarily aimed at rehabilitation of slum dwellers and promotion of affordable housing for the Economically Weaker Sections <strong>(EWS)</strong> and Lower Income Groups <strong>(LIG)</strong>, through credit linked subsidy. As per an official statement issued, a central grant of Rs. 1 lakh per house, on an average, would be made available under the slum rehabilitation programme.
<strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Major Highlights</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, an assistance of Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 2.30 lakh per beneficiary would be provided under different components of the National Urban Housing Mission <strong>(NUHM)</strong> in urban areas to build 2 crore houses to meet the housing shortage, over the next 7 years. As per the earlier approval of the Union Cabinet, there are four components to the NUHM:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ÔÉò In the first category under the redevelopment plan for slums with the participation of private developers using land as a resource component, a central grant of Rs. 1 lakh on an average per beneficiary would be provided.
ÔÉò In the second category, affordable housing through credit linked subsidy scheme, an interest subsidy of 6.50 percent on each housing loan to EWS and LIG by central government.
ÔÉò For third component of affordable housing through private and public sectors, central assistance of Rs. 1.50 lakh to each beneficiary would be provided to promote housing stock for urban poor.
ÔÉò For the fourth category of subsidy for individual beneficiary led construction or enhancement of houses, a central assistance of Rs. 1.50 lakh would be provided to each eligible urban poor to build an own house or renovate the existing ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Deepak Kapoor, President CREDAI Western U.P. and Director, Gulshan Homz</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‚ÄúThe much awaited mission of Housing for all by 2022 is finally underway. Enhancing the standards of living by giving proper homes and subsidised interest rates to EWS and LIG groups will not only aid in fulfilment of their social needs but also help everybody associated with the real estate sector. We are thrilled with this decision and welcome it wholeheartedly.‚Äù</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This move has to be regarded as a milestone for the housing sector as every stakeholder of the industry is sure to get benefited. Currently, taking 10.50 percent as an average interest rate on housing loan, EMI on admissible loan value of Rs. 6 lakh for a15 year loan duration comes out to be Rs. 6,632 for each month. Now with the cabinet approving on the credit linked subsidy to 6.50 percent, the monthly EMIs come down to Rs. 4,050 thereby, offering a saving of Rs. 2,582 per month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Ashok Gupta, CMD, Ajnara India Ltd.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‚ÄúA saving of Rs. 2,500 per month means Rs. 30,000 saved in one annual year. This will greatly increase the purchasing power of people falling under EWS and LIG categories. With this money saved, they will be able to spend it on their children‚Äôs education, personal vehicle, better fooding or clothing thus helping them in a big manner.‚Äù</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Rupesh Gupta, Director, JM Housing</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‚ÄúIt is imperative to understand that Housing for all by 2022 is a bigger term than what is being understood by the common public. There is lot more to it than just providing houses to everyone. With various schemes planned under <strong>NUHM</strong>, an overall benefit of Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 2.30 lakh per beneficiary is assured along with a plan to build 2 crore houses to meet the housing shortage. Thus, the government has planned to not only build more houses, but redevelop slums, decrease interest for poor section, involving private sector and also aid urban poor for renovating the existing homes.‚Äù</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real estate sector in particular is gearing up to deliver its goods to fulfil the government‚Äôs dream of providing a shelter to every citizen of the country. For affordable housing plan to succeed, it is most crucial that affordable houses are developed and offered to the correct target audience. With almost 30 percent of our country‚Äôs population falling under LIG and EWS groups, the current price trend in Indian real estate cannot be afforded by them. Thus, schemes like these are major incentives for this section of the society along with development of affordable homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Kushagr Ansal, Director, Ansal Housing</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‚ÄúReleasing of inexpensive land parcels, land acquisition to become easy, interest rates to be dropped, raw materials to cost less and other such steps will make sure that developers are provoked to construct houses coming under affordable segment and target audience to be EWS and LIG groups primarily. Once these plans start running parallel to each other, Housing for all by 2022 will see visible activity.‚Äù</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Vikas Bhasin, MD, Saya Homes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‚ÄúThis is a welcome move for not only the urban poor of the society but also for realty sector. Real estate as a sector is associated with various other key industries and thus, everybody associated to it will get the benefit. LIG and EWS groups have got news of a lifetime and now we will not only see homes for them, but a boost to their living styles as well, which is one of the key drivers of human and economic development.‚Äù</p>

				<title>5 Reasons Why A Developer‚Äôs Reputation Matters While Buying A Home</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/arvind.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-48177" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Arvind Jain" alt="arvind" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/arvind.jpg" width="115" height="137" /></a>India‚Äôs economy is once again on a sure footing, and people across the country are now confident about buying homes. Purchasing a home is of course a huge investment, and therefore not something where there can be any margin for error ‚Äì and yet, things can and often do go wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most common mistakes that many buyers of property commit is doing business with developers who lack established credentials. Dealing only with reputed <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/builders/index/c/A" target="_blank">real estate builders</a> is the first line of defence against getting cheated out of one‚Äôs money, and being assured of buying a quality product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How can one identify reputable, reliable developers from the huge number of builders constantly putting projects on the market? There are several defining factors:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>1. Legal Sanctity Of The Project</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every residential and commercial building needs to get a variety of permissions from local and government bodies. Reputed developers will ensure that their projects have all the certificates and permissions required by the local authorities. Again, their reputation is at stake and they will not take such matters lightly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All instances of illegal construction that one reads of in the papers today have one factor in common ‚Äì these projects are by unscrupulous or inexperienced builders who either did not care to get their projects properly approved, or did not know of all the approvals and permissions that they need to obtain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>2. Timely Completion</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In most cases, developers will offer their projects for sale before it has actually been completed. On purchasing a home in an under-construction project, the buyer is assured of a certain time-frame in which possession will be given.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reputed developers will not push the possession timeline beyond a rational limit, firstly because they are adequately funded and secondly because they will under no circumstances jeopardize their credibility on the market. Most of the instances of irrationally delayed project completions involve new, under-capitalized and often struggling builders. Reputed developers can and will always stick to the schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>3. Zero-defect Homes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For reputed developers, credibility is the key to their brand recognition ‚Äì it is their primary competitive advantage in the market. They will never offer a homes that have construction defects like bad electrical fittings/wiring, faulty plumbing, water seepage, bad drainage, etc. Quality construction also includes the right size and shape of rooms that are in sync with the overall project design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>4. Project's Structural Integrity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quality control is an important part of every building construction being undertaken by a reputable developer. Their engineers will check and monitor every aspect of the construction process, including soil compactness, proper cement/sand ration, slump testing, drainage engineering and earthquake resistance of the building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This ensures that the project will not suffer from construction-related defects in the future. Choice-based remodeling aside, buyers will not have to pay for structural repairs in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>5. Adequate Amenities</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reputed developers know that it takes more than four walls to make a home, and will always strive to offer a good lifestyle to their customers. They will always provide facilities like proper parking spaces, adequate security, internal access roads, playgrounds, clubhouses and aesthetically landscaped open spaces in their projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fly-by-night developers, on the other hand, will look to provide only the barest essentials in order to keep their prices as low as possible, since their main aim is to attract non-discerning, budget-strung buyers who do not look beyond their financial restrictions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It goes without saying that a home in a project by a reputable, credible developer will cost more than the threadbare offerings of anonymous local builders, but it is always worth it. If one chooses to patronize smaller, inexperienced developers, the only attraction will lie in the price ‚Äì but the price one pays is actually much bigger than the one in the agreement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Problems related to construction legality, lack of security and spurious engineering quality can result in massive future costs, and in the case of outright illegal buildings even a total financial loss The additional amount paid to a reputable, trustworthy developer is an investment one makes into security, peace of mind and a high-quality environment for the family.</p>

				<title>How to Install a Drip Irrigation System in Your Home Garden?</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=52075</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When you have a home garden, drip irrigation is generally the first choice in order to take care of the garden. Through drip irrigation system, continuous water with low pressure reaches the roots of the plant and prevents issues like fungus and weeds. It helps in many ways including economic usage of water and eradicates the water loss due to over-watering and evaporation of water. If your home garden is a bit large, it will lessen the effort of hands-on time for watering.

You can install the drip irrigation system as a do it yourself (DIY) project. But before going ahead, information about the basic components is crucial. The components are available at stores, online and offline.
<ul>
	<li>A vacuum breaker will be needed to attach to the source of water. Also known as Antisiphon unit, vacuum breaker also prevents water to enter the plumbing system of house.</li>
	<li>A filter will be required to prevent clogs. You can have a larger Y-filter or T-filter for the entire drip irrigation system or smaller in-line filters.</li>
	<li>A pressure regulator is needed to guard against high pressure water, high water pressure is dangerous and can cause drip line to burst off.</li>
	<li>One swivel adapter will be needed to tie up plumbing pipes of larger diameter with the smaller diameter drip lines.</li>
	<li>Half inch diameter sized drip tubing will be required for water lines.</li>
	<li>Few fittings like straight coupling, elbow joints, T-joints, shut off valves or four-way joints will be required.</li>
	<li>Other assembly tools like punches, stakes, goof plugs, clamps etc. will also be needed while installing drip irrigation system.</li>
	<li>Emitters are required to water the garden from the lines. They are available with various rates of water delivery. Emitters of different rates can be utilized in one drip irrigation system. Consider the soil type of your garden while buying emitters.</li>
	<li>Other tools like a fertilizer injector, specific emitters like pressure compensating emitters, adjustable drip emitters, Turbulent-flow emitters and non-plugging emitters, low pressure sprayers and sprinklers, a battery timer, a container will also be needed.</li>
	<li>Porous pipe can also be useful however the flow of water cannot be controlled like in emitters.</li>
</ul>
Once all the tools and components are handy, sketch a layout of the garden and plan according to the different water needs of different plants. Plan properly the water flow rate and the spacing of drip lines.

<strong>Step 1 ‚Äì</strong> Start with the source of water. It is mostly an outdoor faucet. Make sure it is working well.
<strong>Step 2 ‚Äì</strong> The head assembly is all the parts which lie between the source of water, which is the outdoor faucet and the tubing. Process with an automatic timer, if you want the system to be an automatic one, then add a vacuum breaker or antisiphon unit, a fertilizer injector (optional), main filter, water pressure regulator and a swivel adapter.
<strong>Step 3-</strong> Insert the main tubing in to the swivel adapter. Roll out the tubing across the garden.
<strong>Step 4 ‚Äì</strong> Add further lines for branching to the main tubing and emitters. 4. Add the outlet lines past the plants and any emitter lines.
<strong>Step 5 ‚Äì</strong> Cut the central line to inject the outlet lines using sharp knife. Connect the fittings with drip lines. Push and twist gently to set the connection, use hot water to soften the tube, if required.
<strong>Step 6 -</strong> Now, when the line network is set, open the faucet, start the water flow to check the drip system, once it is flushed and unclogged then close the ends of lines with clamps.

<strong>Troubleshooting of drip irrigation system of a home garden</strong>
<ul>
	<li>When it comes to issues in drip irrigation system of a home garden, it is not a rocket science to fix it. If water is not coming out it means emitter is clogged, clean it with a brush or change it.</li>
	<li>If emitters are popped out it means water pressure to too high. Get a regulator. Pressure regulators or a pressure reducing valve is important for drip irrigation system.</li>
	<li>In order to prevent water contamination, get a water backflow preventer.</li>
	<li>If winters are very cold, drain the whole system before hard frost. Disconnect the head assembly. Assemble the system once winters are gone in order to avoid leaks and cracks.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Reasons to Choose Laminate Countertops</title>
		<link>https://www.commonfloor.com/guide/?p=52081</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A recent study conducted by the Housing Association or the National Home Builder‚Äôs Society clearly shows that nearly 25 per cent of the new home buyers or property investors specified that they would not pursue or go in to buy a house with a laminate top as 71 per cent of these prospective buyers prefer to use a granite top or a natural stone top.

There are on-going debates whether to use a granite top or embrace the laminate top. Here are some facts on laminate counter tops that may help you get started. Laminate has a few advantages, they are easy to maintain and have a wide range of patterns to choose from. Most of the laminates available in the market today have resistance to stains, heat and also are fire proof. Home owners hold their head high at laminate kitchen countertops as they can be easily cleaned and maintained. Additionally, laminate boards come in different patterns and have a wide range of colours and designs to choose from.

<strong>The pricing point</strong>

Laminates are well known to be affordable and costs much less when compared to many of the materials available in the market. It could cost you something between Rs 550 to Rs 2,500 per square foot. Try to collect samples from a nearby hardware store for comparison and then try them out in your kitchen. Various websites also have digital media or virtual display to offer a glimpse of laminate designs. Some brands of laminates also allow you to design your virtual kitchen and see how your counter tops would look. Remember that laminates can be easily replaced and can cost only a fraction.

<strong>Durability</strong>

Everyone today is aware that countertops take a lot of beating and can wear out rapidly. So you may want to have an idea on how long they could last. Consumer forums and reports are available and they usually carry information on tests on scratches, stains and also scorches. We have noted that there is hardly a major difference in the quality between the most successful and leading brands. Therefore many of the ratings are based on materials and not on brands. It is clear that stains and heat weren‚Äôt a problem, but damages and sharp cuts from knives can leave an unrepairable damage to your laminate.

<strong>The choice over granite</strong>

We have noticed that over the past decades that granite has been the only material widely used on kitchen counters. There have been reports that they have been overused and have caused an environmental concern over its continued mining. There is overwhelming evidence that people continue to use granite, but laminates are better looking and come in with a lots of patterns and designs. The laminate boards also have cool colours and have been recently added with rustic natural look. Laminates tops also come with some decorative edges and can be fabricated with an S-shaped curve. They can also be easily adapted to integrate sinks and wash basins.

Laminates have been around during the groovy 1960‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs and today, they have been making a comeback. They are now more innovatively designed with added features like moisture proofing, termite resistance, fire proofing, durability and the ability to withstand high humidity conditions. Try to shop around the corner and you will be surprised to find an unlimited selection of attractive textures, natural wood grain patterns and rich coloured tops.

Also we suggest you look at countertop ratings and try to compare and have an understanding of some of the pros and cons of different laminate materials, before you make your final decision.]]></content:encoded>

Having your windows treated appropriately according to the weather plays a vital role. <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/tag/window-treatments" target="_blank">Different kinds of window treatments</a> are available for one to choose from, curtains, blinds and valances. These must be selected with utmost care. This is of paramount importance as this keeps the focus on the d√©cor of your home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>What‚Äôs your pick for summer?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What color, fabric, length, lining, rods and so on to choose from really matters? For hot summer days it is a good idea to use light shades and avoid anything bright .A room where too much light enters, one must avoid using very dark shades as it can fade the curtains. If you do feel the absolute need to uses very dark shades then ensure that you have used an appropriate lining, as shielding it with a lining will save the fabric from fading .Use neutral shades or sheer fabric as this will not trap the heat, like a dark shade would do.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The theory that light color reflects and dark color absorb is true here too. If you plan to use a lining it is a good idea to use a double rod and pair it with a sheer curtain. Best options in terms of fabrics are linen, sheer and polyester.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Romance with Roman Blinds</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Considering the option of using a blind is a good idea too. The best option to consider would be the Roman blinds. Blinds also help to block a lot of natural light. Blocking excess light from entering can help to keep the room cool. When these blinds are completely closed, it can help reduce heat. Using blinds will give the window a clean and complete look. Shades of rust, mustard, beige and white are trendier and have a fab look, which help in keeping the heat at bay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Summer Vintage Galore</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combination of a Valance and curtain is a fantastic option if you want your d√©cor to look superlative. This will not only help to shade the room but also create a very classy and vintage impression. A combination of gold and beige, off white or tiny floral prints is a good pick for summer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Simple Tips to Remember</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1) If you are willing to explore, you can also go in for shades of blue in simple geometric patterns.
2) Always keep in mind the kind of curtain rod that you would want to use. Something that is well crafted, styled and durable. The rod finial will make it look complete if it has oval, round, square shape on it.
3) A simple but important tip to remember especially in summer months is the circulation of air. It is therefore vital to open windows and blinds late evening and early morning to let in some cool, fresh air in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping minute details in mind can help not only shade the windows well but help in saving energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whatever window treatment idea you opt for always keep in mind the <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/tag/home-decoration-tips" target="_blank">d√©cor of your home</a> and your lifestyle. Your window treatment should complement every room in the house, making it look cool yet stylish.</p>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ContextMap.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-51977" title="Real Estate Trends in Raj Nagar Extension" alt="Raj Nagar Extension" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ContextMap.png" width="395" height="350" /></a>Delhi NCR has been experiencing phenomenal growth in terms of population. A recent report by the UN State highlighted that, ‚Äúby 2015, the expected population of the National Capital Region will be 28.6 million.‚Äù It raises eyebrows as the region is already gasping for space. Expansion is ‚Äòthe‚Äô only way in which the city can accommodate 28.6 million people in the future. Fortunately, the solution has already clicked the minds of the city-planners. And that‚Äôs how Raj Nagar Extension was born.

The realty market of Raj Nagar Extension has continued to defy the skeptics. Started essentially by 12 developers, many members of the real estate fraternity were quite doubtful about the area‚Äôs success. However, as the project took off, more and more developers pooled in to construct projects here.

Interestingly, the famous saying, <i>the timing was just perfect, rest everything fell into place, </i>holds completely true for this area. At a time when buying <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/delhi-ncr-city" target="_blank">affordable homes in Delhi NCR</a> was becoming a far-fetched dream, developers at Raj Nagar Extension doled out several affordable homes. And rest is history!

In its nascent stage of development, denizens had this doubt whether people will come to this area or not. This doubt was also soon busted as due to affordability, the area grabbed the attention of both end-users and investors alike.

Today, Raj Nagar Extension stands as one of the most important areas not only in Ghaziabad but in the whole of NCR.

<span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em>‚ÄúAs part of ‚ÄòReal Insights‚Äô into real estate, Commonfloor.com¬†has come up with a detailed report on Real Insights ‚Äì Raj Nagar Extension with in-depth analysis based on CommonFloor data.</em></strong></span>
<h3><span style="color: #800000;"><strong><em><span style="color: #800000;">For detailed report</span>‚Äú<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Real-Insights-Raj-Nagar-Extension-A-CommonFloor-Report-2015.pdf?utm_source=guide%20commonfloor%20survey&amp;utm_medium=pdf%20response&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_campaign=locality%20report%20-%20guide" target="_blank"><span style="color: #800000;"><img alt="download-pdf-button" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/download-pdf-button.jpg" width="137" height="56" /></span></a></em></strong></span></h3>
To further enhance the infra quotient of the area, several projects are in the pipeline. The work on the construction of a six-lane expressway and the Metro Line is already on track. The proposed 3-lane bridge over the Hindon River on GT Road will further enhance accessibility to the area.

In the following report, GIS-based tools have been used to analyse the proprietary data of CommonFloor. The report delves into the major aspects such as the growth factors, infra-upgrades and the supply-demand side of the market. For better understanding, we have compared all the aspects of Raj Nagar Extension to neighbouring Indirapuram and Vaishali.]]></content:encoded>

Originating near St. Anthony‚Äôs Friary Church in Koramangala, Sarjapur Road goes all the way up to Sarjapur town of Anekal taluk. But the property developments have mostly been taking place in the stretch between HSR Layout and Sarjapur town, a distance of about 18 kilometres. While covering this length, Sarjapur Road touches many bustling localities which offer a blend of properties in the affordable, mid and luxury categories.

Several big companies have invested along the areas in <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/sarjapur-road-bangalore/lvp-vp3n25" target="_blank">Sarjapur Road</a> to set up their business centres. Having understood the growth prospects, a lot of developers have been cashing on the opportunities sprouting along Sarjapur Road.

In order to ease out traffic on Sarjapur Road, the Chief Minister of Karnataka recently announced an expansion of the road in the State Budget of 2015-16. The stretch between Outer Ring Road junction and Dommasandra will be widened on priority basis.

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong><em>‚ÄúAs part of ‚ÄòReal Insights‚Äô into real estate,¬†<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/" target="_blank"><span style="color: #993300;">Commonfloor.com</span></a>¬†has come up with a detailed report on Real Insights ‚Äì Sarjapur Road¬†</em></strong><strong><em>with in-depth analysis based on CommonFloor data.</em></strong></span>

Along with this, the search for areas offering affordable housing continues in 2015. As per latest research by CommonFloor, the following areas emerged as the top 3 residential real estate markets offering affordable housing in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) during the first half of 2015.

The affordable budget for <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/houses-for-sale-in-mumbai/cfct-mumbai" target="_blank">buying a house in Mumbai</a> is taken to be up to Rs 60 lakh.

<strong>Areas offering affordable housing</strong>

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>1) Mira Road</strong></span>

Mira Road, which is situated just beyond Dahisar, has gained popularity as a fast growing area for buying an affordable house in the last few years. The growth of residential real estate is fuelled by the high property prices in the western and eastern suburbs, and south Mumbai. Proximity and great connectivity to the important business hubs as well as prime localities via the Western Express Highway (WEH) and suburban railway too have greatly contributed to the area‚Äôs growth. With a fast growing infrastructure in terms of civic amenities, transport and social amenities, the area can now be considered a fully developed area rivalling a few other western suburbs.

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>2) Panvel</strong></span>

Panvel is one of the fastest growing areas in MMR. While affordability is one of the main drivers of this growth, the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport. Panvel is also strategically located on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and Bangalore-Mumbai National Highway, giving it excellent connectivity to Mumbai as well as other major cities. Panvel is close to several industrial areas. The area‚Äôs infrastructure is growing at a fast pace, with plans of a Navi Mumbai metro rail and the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link (MTHL) close to the area to improve its accessibility. The area is set to be developed as an educational and IT hub. All these factors make Panvel a sought after area.

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>3) Nala Sopara</strong></span>

Nala Sopara is situated in the Vasai-Virar region of MMR. The area has slowly started gaining prominence in the last 3-4 years as a destination of <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/all-apartments-in-nalasopara-east/psr-52c2854c5d606" target="_blank">affordable apartments in Nala Sopara</a>, primarily due to its lower property prices, good connectivity to Mumbai via the WEH and rail.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/trends-in-premium-housing-space.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-50837 alignleft" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Real estate trends in New Panvel" alt="trends in premium housing space" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/trends-in-premium-housing-space-300x214.jpg" width="300" height="214" /></a>It is an undeniable fact that property prices in the core areas of Mumbai are increasingly becoming dearer by the day. With demand for housing growing in the <strong><em>Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR)</em></strong>, the property prices in several areas of MMR too are going up. But, you don‚Äôt need to worry as there are a few fast growing areas in the region with lower property prices. New Panvel in Navi Mumbai is one such area, which is coming up fast and holds excellent future growth potential. The area is a new node being developed by the City and Industrial Development Corporation <em><strong>(CIDCO)</strong></em>.

<em>Given below is a snapshot of New Panvel‚Äôs real estate scenario.</em>

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Key growth drivers</strong></span>

- New Panvel is situated in the Panvel region of <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/navi_mumbai-city" target="_blank">Navi Mumbai</a> on the banks of Panvel Creek. It lies strategically on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and eastern side of Bangalore-Mumbai National Highway. This provides excellent connectivity between the area and the rest of the country.
- The area has good connectivity via road and rail. The upcoming Navi Mumbai metro in Panvel will provide metro connectivity to the area.
- New Panvel also lies near JNPT in Nhava Sheva. The proposed Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link <strong>(MTHL)</strong> between JNPT and Sewri in Mumbai will reduce the travel distance between the area and Mumbai.
- The area also lies next to the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport.
- New Panvel is close to several industrial areas such as Taloja, Patalganga, Khopoli and Roha. Major companies such as L&amp;T Ltd, Hindustan Organics Chemicals Ltd, Reliance, IPCL and ONGC are situated close to New Panvel. A Reliance SEZ is coming up in the area‚Äôs vicinity.
- It is a well-planned node and hence, it is witnessing organised development. It is being developed under a ‚ÄòMega City Project‚Äô as a residential as well as commercial node. Hence, it is set to witness development as a major education and IT hub.

<span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Housing trends</strong></span>

<strong>Available property type:</strong> New Panvel has been witnessing high property transaction only over the last 3-4 years due to its recent development. Most of the projects in the area are multi-storeyed apartments. There are also a few builder floor apartments and <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/navi-mumbai-property/in-new-panvel-a35641/for-sale/independent-house-ht" target="_blank">independent houses in Panvel</a>.

<strong>BHK-wise availability:</strong> New Panvel has 1 and 2BHK units in New Panvel¬†dominating. A few 1RK and 3BHK units too may be found here.

<strong>Segment-wise availability:</strong> According to a latest research by CommonFloor, almost 70 per cent of the properties available here are in the affordable budget range (up to Rs 60 lakh) and about 20 per cent are in the mid-segment (Rs 60 lakh ‚Äì 1.2 crore). The remaining are in the luxury and ultra-luxury segments (beyond Rs 1.2 crore).

<strong>Approximate property prices:</strong> The approximate weighted average price (<strong>WAP</strong>) of newly launched <a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/new-panvel-/lvp-wjj215" target="_blank">property in New Panvel</a> is about Rs 3,900-4,200 per sq. ft. It is expected to grow further with more development.

<strong>Rental trends:</strong> The approximate monthly rentals in the area are about Rs 10-11 per sq. ft. The approximate rental yield is 2.2 per cent, with immense future growth potential.

Hence, if you want to invest in a property in a fast growing area in MMR, New Panvel must be on your watch list.]]></content:encoded>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With a country of more than 1 billion individuals heading toward massive globalization and urbanization, the balance between resources and their optimization requires a systematic, efficient plan. The solution ‚Äì Smart Cities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To avoid urban chaos in future, the government has already chalked out a plan to develop 100 smart cities in urban settlements across India with a budgetary allocation of ‚Çπ 7,000 crore. Keeping Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at the core of this plan, cities are expected to become more productive in sectors like transport, energy, healthcare, water and waste. These cities will also be equipped to adapt to global changes and challenges faster as compared to those with a traditional set of relationships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a visionary in real estate industry, CommonFloor endorses the government‚Äôs view and plans to promote the concept of smart cities.¬†<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Using GIS map as a tool, CommonFloor has explained the future smart cities of North, West, South and Central India. The interesting fact is that, all the information has been put keeping the real estate perspective in mind.

<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Modi.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-52032" title="Smart City in India" alt="Narendra Modi announcing Smart City" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Modi.png" width="206" height="267" /></a>June 25, 2015 will be marked as an important day in the history of Indian development. Inching a step forward for transforming urban infrastructure, Prime Minister Narendra Modi formally unveiled three mega projects- Smart City , Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) and Housing for All. In addition to bringing a change in the skyline of several cities, the projects are also expected to bridge the infra-gap to make Indian cities more liveable.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is empowering to see that the decision to make cities smart will be taken by the people of the city and the local administration. This clearly indicates that there will be lot of inclusive planning. Further, the ‚Äòcity challenge competition‚Äô is a great approach as lot of counter magnets will be formed. Thus, instead of lopsided growth, the nation will see a holistic growth, which will surely have a far-reaching impact on the overall economic development of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the backdrop of this important development, CommonFloor spoke to the real estate fraternity to know their views.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcoming the move, Amit Modi, Vice President CREDAI Western UP and Whole Time Director, ABA CORP said, ‚ÄòWe believe that for the first time the grants being allocated for these initiatives over a period of the next 5 years, seem to be realistic and practicle, considering the size and scale that has to be achieved which indeed is a welcome departure from the fact that the earlier amounts being announced for national infrastructure development initiatives were largely insufficient.‚Äô</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reiterating his views, Deepak Kapoor, President CREDAI Western U.P. said, "Approval to the smart cities and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) will bring in a lot of development to the country. The idea of smart cities is for the greater development of the country and will help us be counted as among the developed nations.‚Äù</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While industry experts clearly seems to welcome the move, clarity on certain aspects is what they are looking for now. Prashant Tiwari, Chairman, Prateek Group opined, "We are waiting for the clear guidelines behind this idea and expect that once the concept is clear to everyone the work will pick up pace. As it is based on PPP model, it is expected to get good result provided all the parties involved show good intent. And we believe because of the intensity of this programme, it will definitely turn out to be a good one for people, for economy and for country in general."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Echoing similar views, R.K Arora, Chairman, Supertech said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a welcome opportunity for the private companies to work in partnership with government under PPP model to attain government aim of Housing for All by 2022. Constructing two crore houses is a welcoming challenge for developer community as the prime importance is to overcome the shortage of houses for the common man.‚Äô‚Äô</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having said all this, Amit Modi has made a very crucial point. He is of the opinion that ‚Äò‚Äôonce these initiatives are actually implemented on ground, they will also have an economic multiplier effect on the nation‚Äôs economy as a whole, since such huge infrastructure development initiatives will require a massive increase in production and manufacturing output of the country, and as a result also create humongous employment opportunities not just in the infrastructure sector, but also in manufacturing sector.‚Äô‚Äô</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Undoubtedly, there is a lot to be done for achieving the vision of the Prime Minister, hence while CommonFloor welcomes these initiatives, we would like to reiterate that<em> ‚ÄòExecution on ground is the key‚Äô.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All said and done, the nation is surely progressing. With words turning into actions, we hope for <em>‚Äòacche din‚Äô</em> ahead.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hrishi-formals1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-40650" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Smart City India" alt="Hrishi" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hrishi-formals1-199x300.jpg" width="159" height="240" /></a>The words Smart Cities, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation <strong>(AMRUT)</strong> and Housing for All were surrounding our eyes and ears for over a year now with lots of questions arising with it whether this will go down in the history books as just a dream or reality. Marking a major initiative for the urban development and revolution in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has finally launched the Smart Cities mission, AMRUT and Housing for All; keeping on track with his promise to the nation to bring a transformation in life of every citizen of the country and to put India on the global map as the most rapidly developing country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‚ÄúThe promise of Acche Din by the government was not just a mere statement as now we see the momentum gaining pace. Smart cities, AMRUT and Housing for all schemes will not only ensure a shelter to every household but will guarantee transformation of their lifestyles which is crucial to overall development of the country. With these schemes now launched, there will be an upsurge of job opportunities, sound infrastructure and basic civic setup for each city which is most significant for urbanisation to take place,‚Äù says Deepak Kapoor, President CREDAI Western U.P. &amp; Director, Gulshan Homz. The three big ticket projects ‚Äì Smart Cities mission, AMRUT and Housing for all are now named as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna <strong>(PMAY)</strong> and is worth Rs. 4 lakh crore approx.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Smart City and AMRUT projects will draw Rs 48,000 crores and Rs 50,000 crores respectively, in central grants over the next five years. Housing for all by 2022 plan will see a government expenditure of about Rs 3 lakh crores during the next 7 seven years which is aimed at constructing 2 crore affordable houses in urban areas for slum dwellers and people falling under Economically Weaker Sections <strong>(EWS)</strong> and Lower income Groups <strong>(LIG)</strong>. Under the housing scheme, interest subsidy of 6.5 percent on housing loans with tenure upto 15 years will be provided to EWS and LIGs, offering them a benefit of about Rs. 2.3 lakhs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For AMRUT, 500 cities having a population of 1 lakh or more will be chosen for this project. Speaking about the major affect that these plans will have, Mr. Praveen Tyagi, CMD, VVIP states ‚ÄúThe AMRUT plan aims at urbanisation of 500 cities whereas the Smart Cities plan is targeted to enhance the quality of life of 100 identified cities and towns which will be confirmed by superior infrastructure, smart living through smart features, better services at disposal and a clean, green and much sustainable environment for the population. Housing for all scheme will act as a perfect catalyst here by enhancing the purchasing power of EWS and LIGs by reducing their burden through decreasing home loan amounts.‚Äù</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along with the launch of three schemes, PM also unveiled the criteria and guidelines for the smart cities and other schemes apart from releasing operational guidelines for the three urban missions, unveiling logos and tag lines. Modi also stated that neither the centre nor the states will have any discretion in choosing 100 cities through a competition for smart cities scheme. The launch event is to be followed by a 2 day workshop where over 1000 mayors, municipal heads, ministers concerned from states and their chief secretaries will take part. Uttar Pradesh is ready to lead the pack here with the opportunity to nominate 13 cities to be developed as smart cities and 54 cities identified under the AMRUT scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‚ÄúUttar Pradesh is one of the largest states of India with a major scope of development available here thus, 13 cities identified as smart cities and 54 cities for AMRUT scheme will mean that UP will get the most out this Smart India mission. Overall, the plan looks very well laid down with proper distribution of funds planned for Smart cities mission, AMRUT and Housing for all as well. With the three most important schemes now underway, India is now on a path of smart development,‚Äù says Ashok Gupta, CMD, Ajnara India Ltd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After UP, Tamil Nadu is placed at second position with 12 smart cities and 33 AMRUT cities being allotted. Maharashtra has been selected for 10 smart cities and 37 AMRUT cities with Gujarat and Karnataka are eligible for 6 smart cities each and 31 &amp; 21 AMRUT cities respectively. Delhi has been allotted one smart and AMRUT city. As per the criteria finalised by the government for the smart cities project, West Bengal and Rajasthan get to nominate 4 cities a piece with Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab for 3 cities; Odisha, Haryana, Telangana and Chhatisgarh two cities; and J &amp; K, Kerela, Jharkhand, Assam, Himachal, Goa, Arunachal and Chandigarh, one city each.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likewise, for the AMRUT scheme, 31 cities have been identified in Andhra Pradesh, 30 for Rajasthan, 28 in West Bengal, 27 in Bihar, 19 in Odisha and Haryana, 18 in Kerala, 17 in Punjab, 15 in Telangana and 10 in Chhatisgarh. Kushagr Ansal, Director, Ansal Housing says ‚ÄúThe much awaited dream of transforming India is finally turning into a reality. It is imperative to understand that these 3 projects are forming a hierarchy of necessity for our country. Housing for all is the base, as it crucial to first make sure that everyone gets a roof over their head. In the middle will be the AMRUT plan as, rejuvenation and urban transformation is a need to move further towards smart living and get over from basic living. Finally, the cities that already meet the basic requirement are now looked upon to be made ready for the next level infrastructure.‚Äù</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moving ahead, now since the plan is underway the government will be doing its bit to develop the next level infrastructure for the country, but it will require most assistance from the private players of the country along with FDI. ‚ÄúThe plan to develop 100 smart and 500 AMRUT cities will not succeed until the entire nation stands as one unit. The public private partnership model will best fit here as now there will be an immense requirement of quality infrastructure and smart facilities. The Indian real estate market which was experiencing a sluggish growth for many years now is greatly welcoming this move as the government‚Äôs budget outlay for PMAY of Rs. 4 lakh crores is expected to be invested into the Indian real estate sector directly or indirectly and that also at a national level‚Äù, states Rupesh Gupta, Director, JM Housing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adding to the view, Rajesh Goyal, Vice President CREDAI Western UP &amp; MD, RG Group says ‚ÄúThe idea of spruce urban spaces through 100 Smart Cities and AMRUT to adjust the burgeoning number of people have been pivotal to Modi‚Äôs visionary election manifesto from the beginning. Finally, Union Cabinet cleared the projects and has allocated gargantuan amount for the twin projects. FDI allured by these projects and efficient allocation and execution of the same can change the face of urban lifestyle in India as well as will propel much needed liquidity in the economy.‚Äù</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three projects launched today are interdependent and has a common vision of developing the nation and its people. ‚ÄúJob opportunities for all, homes to everyone, smart features, better lifestyle, superior infrastructure, higher GDP, more FDI and increasing HDI will be a few common phenomenon that we will all witness in the upcoming 5 to 7 years in India. We are on a road to develop better and develop smart thereby ensuring an overall development of the economy and its people. Now since these 3 projects have got a green signal, the markets and industries will see a major boost as now there is a lot of work in hand for everyone,‚Äù concludes Prithvi Raj Kasana, MD, Morpheus Group.</p>

				<title>Find a Home Based on your Salary</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Owning a home is a dream nurtured by almost every individual. However, in the home buying journey, selecting a budget is the most herculean task. Thus, in order to solve this problem, CommonFloor has tried to analyse ‚Äòhow much worth house you can afford‚Äô based on the salary you draw on an annual basis and the loan eligibility. Using our exhaustive database, one can easily find a suitable locality.</p>
<span style="line-height: 1.5em">The below inferences has been derived keeping in mind four points. First, you will pay 80 per cent of the property cost as Equated Monthly Instalments (EMIs) and 20 per cent as down payment. Second, the loan tenure is for 20 years. Third, in an ideal scenario, out of your total salary, 40 per cent can be used for housing. Fourth, the interest rate on your <span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/category/real-estate/home-loan" target="_blank">home loan</a></span> is 10 per cent.</span>

&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #993300"><strong>How Much Loan am I eligible to?</strong></span></p>
<span style="line-height: 1.5em">Using a reverse EMI algorithm, we present you the maximum home loan eligibility.</span>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Formula:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/B38aaM1OwSaCHo9NSPa44qE2M0HrN7GtoVsT41SheqitdseOoYpkYs34U-oH08CAht1mhfwTr0PDzyWk97-kv21akkBes9rU2GO_ar9uo9Spnp8U-PsPZnYmzIqFV283krra_NA" width="NaN" height="NaN" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Where: Assuming PV as the value of the property one can afford, S is the maximum monthly installment to be paid (i.e. 40% of the net income), r is the periodic interest rate divided by 100 (annual interest rate also divided by 12 in case of monthly installments), and n is the total number of payments (for a 20 year loan with monthly payments n = 20 √ó 12 = 240).</p>
<p dir="ltr">For instance: Assuming your net annual income is Rs 10,00,000, and maximum monthly installments affordable is Rs 33,333. Now if the interest rate on the home loan is 10 per cent (r= 0.1/12) with a tenure of 20 years (n=240 months). Thus, applying the above formula, you can afford a property worth Rs 43, 18,880.</p>
<img style="line-height: 1.5em" title="Loan eligibility &amp; EMI calculator" alt="Loan eligibility and EMI calculator" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TU8p2aR1yEoj6926pw6D2jVZpOAcUrfKUjkVgpaT9FvXoIqSV2a6VRHd7gKEhiFucdgfWzOGnMKJxFYW9NGKRePsXclDcDyBmBe-grffCJkM1m8Cm10LlAmWJ-RG1JBqADQj-qs" width="NaN" height="NaN" />
<p dir="ltr">Thumb-rule: For a quick calculation of these values, one can multiply the net annual income value with an approximate constant (4.35) to get to the worth of property one can afford.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Independent-Houses-in-Bangalore.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-52127" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 1px 10px;" title="Independent Houses in Bangalore" alt="Independent Houses in Bangalore" src="http://www.commonfloor.com/guide/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Independent-Houses-in-Bangalore.jpg" width="359" height="269" /></a>In this report, the current scenario and impact of various infrastructure initiatives on independent houses is discussed. Further, we have identified certain top localities for independent houses and discussed them in various parameters.

&nbsp;

Bangalore residential market has essentially been witness to the Independent houses culture since long. While apartments clearly dominate the property-type in the city, independent houses in Bangalore still continue to attract many buyers.

&nbsp;

As per CommonFloor data, South Bangalore has maximum share (<a href="http://www.commonfloor.com/houses-for-sale-in-bangalore/cfct-bangalore" target="_blank">independent houses in Bangalore</a>), both in terms of sale and rent while Central part is at the bottom. This is mainly because of relatively low land prices in South Bangalore in comparison to Central Bangalore. East Bangalore also has high demand for independent houses. Presence of Nice Ring Road, which connects more than 4 major roads, is also a driving factor for high demand in South Bangalore.

&nbsp;

<strong><span style="color: #993300;">‚ÄúAs part of ‚ÄòReal Insights‚Äô into real estate,¬†Commonfloor.com¬†has come up with a detailed report on Real Insights ‚Äì Independent houses- Bangalore¬†with in-depth analysis based on CommonFloor data.</span></strong>
